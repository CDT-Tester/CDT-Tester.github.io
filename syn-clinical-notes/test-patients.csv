- General: Alert, oriented to person and place, mild disorientation to time
- HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, mild papilledema on fundoscopic exam
- Neurological: Right upper extremity strength 4/5, right lower extremity strength 4+/5, decreased fine motor coordination on right side, subtle right facial droop
- Gait: Mild unsteadiness, favoring left side
- Romberg: Positive with eyes closed

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast (03/10/2014)**: 7cm convexity meningioma in the left frontal region with significant mass effect on adjacent brain parenchyma. Moderate surrounding edema. Characteristic dural tail sign present. No evidence of brain invasion.

**CT Head**: Confirms the presence of the mass with calcifications typical of meningioma. No evidence of hyperostosis or bone invasion.

## ASSESSMENT
63-year-old female with a 7cm left frontal convexity meningioma, WHO Grade I (presumptive). Given her history of childhood radiation exposure, this represents a radiation-induced meningioma. Current symptoms are consistent with mass effect from the tumor.

## PLAN
After thorough discussion with the patient regarding treatment options, we have decided to pursue a conservative, watchful waiting approach for the following reasons:
1. Patient preference to avoid surgery if possible
2. Occupation as a librarian can be maintained with current level of function
3. Seizures are currently isolated events and can be managed medically

Management plan:
1. Initiate Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis
2. Start Dexamethasone 4mg BID with taper over 2 weeks to reduce perilesional edema
3. Repeat MRI in 3 months to assess stability vs. growth
4. Implement compensatory strategies for fine motor deficits at work
5. Regular neurological assessment every 3 months
6. Patient to maintain seizure diary and report any new/worsening symptoms immediately

Patient understands that surgical intervention may become necessary if symptoms worsen significantly or if rapid growth is observed on follow-up imaging.

# NEUROSURGERY OPERATIVE NOTE

**Date: January 5, 2016**
**Patient**: Female, 65 years old
**Procedure**: Left frontal craniotomy for resection of meningioma

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left frontal convexity meningioma, radiation-induced

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left frontal convexity meningioma, WHO Grade II (atypical) based on intraoperative frozen section

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
Under general anesthesia, a left frontoparietal craniotomy was performed. Upon dural opening, a firm, well-circumscribed tumor with typical meningioma appearance was identified with dural attachment. Areas of brain invasion were noted during dissection, confirming suspicions from preoperative imaging. Subtotal resection (Simpson Grade IV) was achieved due to significant adherence to critical neurovascular structures and brain invasion. Estimated 85% of tumor mass was removed. Frozen section showed features consistent with atypical meningioma (WHO Grade II). Hemostasis was achieved, dura was closed in watertight fashion, and bone flap was replaced.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
350 mL

## COMPLICATIONS
None during procedure

## PLAN
1. Transfer to Neurosurgical ICU for postoperative monitoring
2. Continue antiepileptic medications
3. Steroid taper over 2 weeks
4. Await final pathology report
5. Discuss case at Neuro-Oncology MDT for adjuvant treatment recommendations

## ASSESSMENT
1. 4.2 cm suprasellar/parasellar meningioma (presumed WHO Grade I) with mass effect on optic chiasm causing bitemporal hemianopsia and likely affecting pituitary function leading to hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea.
2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, suboptimally controlled
3. Hypertension
4. Obesity, Class II

## PLAN
After thorough discussion of management options including risks and benefits of surgery versus conservative management, we have opted for a watchful waiting approach with close monitoring given:
1. Patient's preference to avoid surgery if possible
2. Significant risks associated with surgical intervention in this location
3. Relatively stable neurological status despite symptoms

Specific management plan:
1. **Monitoring:**
   - Follow-up MRI in 3 months to establish growth rate
   - Formal visual field testing every 3 months
   - Endocrinology consultation for pituitary function assessment

2. **Symptom management:**
   - Topiramate 25mg daily, titrating to 50mg BID for headache prophylaxis
   - Cabergoline 0.25mg twice weekly for hyperprolactinemia/galactorrhea

3. **Diabetes management:**
   - Referral to diabetes educator for lifestyle modification reinforcement
   - Continue current metformin regimen
   - Target HbA1c < 7.0%

4. **Patient education:**
   - Warning signs requiring immediate attention (sudden visual deterioration, severe headache, altered mental status)
   - Importance of medication adherence and follow-up appointments

5. **Return to clinic in 3 months with repeat MRI and visual field testing**

# OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date:** March 25, 2014
**Procedure:** Right pterional craniotomy for resection of suprasellar/parasellar meningioma
**Surgeon:** Dr. [Neurosurgeon]

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Suprasellar/parasellar meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Suprasellar/parasellar meningioma, WHO Grade I (pending final pathology)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head turned 30 degrees to the left. A right pterional craniotomy was performed. Upon dural opening, the frontal lobe was gently retracted to expose the optic nerve and carotid artery. The tumor was identified and found to be firm, well-vascularized, and compressing the optic chiasm. The tumor was debulked internally using ultrasonic aspirator. Careful dissection was performed to separate the tumor from the optic nerves, chiasm, and pituitary stalk. Approximately 85% of the tumor was resected (Simpson Grade II). A small portion of tumor firmly adherent to the cavernous sinus was intentionally left behind to avoid neurovascular injury. Hemostasis was achieved, and the dura was closed in a watertight fashion. The bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates. The wound was closed in layers.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
350 mL

## COMPLICATIONS
None

## DISPOSITION
Patient transferred to Neuro ICU in stable condition.

# OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date:** December 7, 2015
**Procedure:** Right frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of recurrent parasellar meningioma
**Surgeon:** Dr. [Neurosurgeon]

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent right parasellar meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent right parasellar meningioma

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
Previous right pterional craniotomy was reopened. Significant scarring was encountered requiring meticulous dissection. The recurrent tumor was identified and found to be more firm and vascular than during the first surgery. The tumor was debulked internally using ultrasonic aspirator. The portion extending into the cavernous sinus was carefully dissected but complete removal was not possible due to adherence to critical neurovascular structures. Approximately 70% of the recurrent tumor was resected (Simpson Grade III). Intraoperative neuromonitoring showed stable signals throughout. Hemostasis was achieved, and closure was performed in the standard fashion.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
450 mL

## COMPLICATIONS
None

## DISPOSITION
Patient transferred to Neuro ICU in stable condition.

# MULTIDISCIPLINARY TUMOR BOARD NOTE
**Date:** May 23, 2016
**Patient:** 49-year-old female with recurrent WHO Grade II atypical meningioma

## CASE PRESENTATION
49-year-old female with recurrent WHO Grade II atypical meningioma status post two subtotal resections, FSRT, and SRS. Recent MRI shows enlarging residual tumor and new falcine lesion. Patient experiencing worsening visual and cognitive symptoms.

## DISCUSSION
- **Neurosurgery:** Third surgery carries significant risks given prior treatments and location. Complete resection remains unlikely.
- **Radiation Oncology:** Patient has received maximum safe radiation dose to the parasellar region. Re-irradiation would carry unacceptable risk of optic neuropathy.
- **Neuro-oncology:** Limited systemic treatment options. Consider hydroxyurea or bevacizumab off-label. Recent phase II trials of somatostatin receptor antagonists show modest benefit in some patients.
- **Pathology:** TRAF7 mutation associated with more aggressive behavior. Consider additional molecular testing for potential targeted therapies.
- **Ophthalmology:** Visual deterioration suggests urgent intervention needed to preserve remaining vision.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Attempt third surgical debulking focused on relieving optic chiasm compression
2. Consider enrollment in clinical trial of targeted therapy based on molecular profile
3. If surgery declined or unsuccessful, consider off-label bevacizumab
4. Continue high-dose steroids to manage edema
5. Repeat imaging in 6 weeks or sooner if clinical deterioration

# OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date:** June 6, 2016
**Procedure:** Right frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of recurrent parasellar meningioma
**Surgeon:** Dr. [Neurosurgeon]

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent right parasellar atypical meningioma with optic chiasm compression

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent right parasellar atypical meningioma

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
Previous right frontotemporal craniotomy was reopened. Extensive scarring and adhesions were encountered requiring tedious microdissection. The tumor was found to be extremely firm and hypervascular with significant adhesion to the optic apparatus and carotid artery. The primary goal of decompressing the optic chiasm was achieved, but only approximately 40% of the tumor could be safely removed (Simpson Grade IV). Intraoperative frozen section confirmed recurrent atypical meningioma. The dura was closed with a pericranial graft, and the bone flap was replaced.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
700 mL

## COMPLICATIONS
Intraoperative bleeding requiring 2 units PRBC transfusion

## DISPOSITION
Patient transferred to Neuro ICU in stable condition.

# PATHOLOGY REPORT
**Date:** June 9, 2016
**Specimen:** Recurrent parasellar meningioma

## MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Sections show a highly cellular meningothelial neoplasm with sheet-like growth pattern. Increased mitotic activity (8 mitoses per 10 HPF) and focal areas of necrosis. Tumor cells show nuclear pleomorphism and prominent nucleoli.

## IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
- EMA: Positive
- Progesterone receptor: Weakly positive
- Ki-67 proliferation index: 15% (significantly increased from previous 8%)
- SSTR2: Positive

## MOLECULAR STUDIES
- TRAF7 mutation: Positive
- Additional mutations in TERT promoter identified

## DIAGNOSIS
Anaplastic meningioma, WHO Grade III

## COMMENT
The increased mitotic activity, presence of necrosis, and markedly elevated Ki-67 proliferation index indicate progression to a WHO Grade III anaplastic meningioma. The presence of TERT promoter mutation is associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis.

# NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL NOTE
**Date: March 15, 2014**
**Patient**: 47-year-old female, blood type O
**Attending Neurosurgeon**: Dr. Elizabeth Morgan

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive visual field defects, severe headaches, recent onset of galactorrhea, fatigue, cognitive difficulties affecting work performance

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient presents with progressive bitemporal hemianopsia over the past 4 months. She reports severe headaches unresponsive to OTC medications, different from her usual migraine pattern. Additional symptoms include recent onset of galactorrhea, fatigue, occasional nausea, decreased libido, weight gain despite diet attempts, and mild right-sided facial numbness. Patient notes significant difficulty with concentration and memory at work, affecting her performance as a software developer.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 8 years ago, managed with metformin 1000mg BID
- Obesity (BMI 36.2)
- Hypertension diagnosed 3 years ago

- Works as a software developer and perfumer
- Occupational exposure to various chemicals as perfumer for 15 years
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use

## FAMILY HISTORY
- Maternal aunt with breast cancer
- No known family history of neurological disorders

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Sumatriptan as needed for migraines
- OTC analgesics (ineffective for current headaches)

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
- Vital Signs: BP 142/88, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 36.7Â°C, BMI 36.2
- General: Obese female in no acute distress
- HEENT: Mild right-sided facial numbness in V2 distribution
- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Neurological:
  - CN II: Bitemporal hemianopsia on confrontation testing
  - CN V: Decreased sensation in right V2 distribution
  - Motor: 5/5 strength throughout
  - Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric
  - Coordination: Intact
  - Gait: Normal

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
- MRI Brain with and without contrast (03/10/2014): 6.1 cm suprasellar/parasellar mass with homogeneous enhancement, consistent with meningioma. Mass compressing optic chiasm and extending into right cavernous sinus. No significant surrounding edema.
- Visual field testing: Confirms bitemporal hemianopsia
- Laboratory studies:
  - Mild hyperprolactinemia (likely due to stalk effect)
  - HbA1c: 7.2%
  - Otherwise normal basic labs

## ASSESSMENT
47-year-old female with a large 6.1 cm suprasellar/parasellar meningioma (WHO Grade I presumed, pending histological confirmation if surgery pursued). Tumor is causing compression of the optic chiasm resulting in bitemporal hemianopsia and likely causing headaches and endocrine disturbances.

## PLAN
After detailed discussion with the patient regarding treatment options including surgical resection versus conservative management, patient expresses preference for non-surgical approach initially given her concerns about surgical risks and impact on her work. I respect her decision and recommend a conservative approach with close monitoring:

1. Conservative management with close surveillance
   - MRI brain in 3 months to assess for any rapid growth
   - If stable, subsequent MRI at 6-month intervals for the first year

2. Referral to neuro-ophthalmology for baseline assessment and monitoring of visual fields

3. Endocrinology consultation for evaluation of pituitary function and management of potential endocrine abnormalities

4. Medical management of symptoms:
   - Topiramate 25mg daily, titrating to 50mg BID for headache prophylaxis
   - Continue current medications for diabetes and hypertension

5. Lifestyle modifications:
   - Weight management program referral
   - Sleep hygiene counseling
   - Consideration of occupational exposure to chemicals as perfumer - recommend workplace assessment

6. Patient education regarding symptoms that would warrant immediate evaluation (acute visual deterioration, severe headache with vomiting, altered mental status)

7. Follow-up appointment in 1 month to assess symptom response to medical management

I have explained to the patient that while we are pursuing conservative management initially, surgical intervention may become necessary if her symptoms worsen significantly, if the tumor shows rapid growth, or if visual function deteriorates. The patient understands and agrees with this approach.

# NEUROSURGERY OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date: March 1, 2015**
**Patient**: 48-year-old female
**Surgeon**: Dr. Elizabeth Morgan

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Suprasellar/parasellar meningioma with optic apparatus compression

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Suprasellar/parasellar meningioma, WHO Grade I (pending final pathology)

## PROCEDURE
Extended right pterional craniotomy for subtotal resection of suprasellar/parasellar meningioma

## DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE
After induction of general anesthesia, patient was positioned supine with head turned 30 degrees to the left and fixed in Mayfield pins. Standard extended pterional craniotomy was performed. After dural opening, frontal lobe was gently retracted to expose the optic nerve and carotid artery. The tumor was identified as a firm, well-circumscribed mass compressing the optic chiasm. Internal debulking was performed followed by careful dissection of tumor from the optic apparatus. Tumor extending into the cavernous sinus was left in place to avoid cranial nerve injury. Approximately 80% of tumor was resected with excellent decompression of the optic apparatus. Hemostasis was achieved. Dural closure, bone flap replacement, and standard closure were performed. Patient tolerated the procedure well. Estimated blood loss was 350cc.

## PATHOLOGY
Preliminary: WHO Grade I meningioma with no atypical features

## PLAN
1. Transfer to Neurosurgical ICU for standard post-craniotomy care
2. Dexamethasone taper
3. Post-operative MRI within 48 hours
4. Neurological checks with attention to visual function
5. Final pathology review when available

# RADIATION ONCOLOGY CONSULTATION
**Date: January 15, 2016**
**Patient**: 48-year-old female
**Attending Radiation Oncologist**: Dr. Michael Chen

## REASON FOR CONSULTATION
Evaluation for stereotactic radiosurgery for residual WHO Grade I parasellar meningioma

## HISTORY
48-year-old female with history of large suprasellar/parasellar meningioma status post subtotal resection on March 1, 2015. Recent imaging shows slight growth of residual tumor in cavernous sinus from 1.5 cm to 1.7 cm over 6 months. Patient also reports new cognitive symptoms including transient confusion episodes.

## IMAGING REVIEW
MRI Brain (12/14/2015): Residual enhancing mass in right cavernous sinus measuring 1.7 cm, increased from 1.5 cm on prior study from June 2015. Mass demonstrates homogeneous enhancement consistent with meningioma.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Patient is an appropriate candidate for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to residual tumor. Given the proximity to optic apparatus, recommend fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy rather than single-fraction SRS.

Treatment plan:
1. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy to residual tumor
   - Dose: 25 Gy in 5 fractions
   - Treatment to begin February 1, 2016
   
2. Discussed potential side effects including:
   - Fatigue
   - Temporary worsening of existing symptoms
   - Risk of radiation injury to adjacent structures
   - Very small long-term risk of malignant transformation
   
3. Patient understands and consents to treatment plan

- MRI Brain with contrast (performed today): 3.3 cm extra-axial, dural-based mass in the left frontoparietal convexity with homogeneous enhancement, consistent with meningioma. Moderate perilesional edema. No midline shift.
- EEG: Mild focal slowing over the left central region, no epileptiform discharges.
- Basic labs: WBC 7.2, Hgb 13.4, Plt 245, Comprehensive metabolic panel within normal limits.

**ASSESSMENT**:
1. 3.3 cm left frontoparietal convexity meningioma, likely WHO Grade I (based on imaging characteristics)
2. Focal seizure, likely related to meningioma
3. Right arm weakness, likely related to mass effect from meningioma and surrounding edema
4. Headaches, likely related to meningioma

**PLAN**:
After thorough discussion with the patient regarding treatment options, including surgical resection versus conservative management, patient expressed preference for non-surgical approach initially. Given the moderate size, location, and symptoms that are currently manageable:

1. Conservative management with close monitoring
2. Anti-epileptic medication: Levetiracetam 500mg BID to prevent further seizures
3. Dexamethasone 4mg BID with taper over 2 weeks to reduce perilesional edema
4. Follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess for any growth
5. Provided education regarding symptoms that would warrant immediate medical attention
6. Discussed potential need for intervention if symptoms worsen or tumor shows significant growth
7. Occupational therapy referral to assist with adaptation at workplace
8. Recommended reduced working hours temporarily (20-25 hours/week) for 4 weeks

Patient understands the risks and benefits of conservative management versus surgical intervention and prefers watchful waiting approach at this time. Will reassess at next visit.

**DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE**:
Reopening of previous craniotomy was performed. Multiple infiltrative, highly vascular lesions were identified with significant brain invasion. The dominant lesion was resected, but complete resection of all lesions was not feasible due to their infiltrative nature and involvement of eloquent cortex. Hemostasis was secured, and the wound was closed in layers.

Estimated blood loss: 700cc
Complications: None

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
51-year-old female with progressively enlarging right parasagittal meningioma with worsening symptoms. Given the continued growth and symptom progression despite medical management, I have had a detailed discussion with the patient regarding management options:

1. Surgical resection would provide definitive diagnosis and symptom relief but carries risks given the location near the motor strip.
2. Stereotactic radiosurgery could provide growth control without immediate surgical risks.
3. Continued observation with medical management is becoming less favorable given progression.

After thorough discussion, patient now wishes to proceed with stereotactic radiosurgery:

1. Referral to radiation oncology for stereotactic radiosurgery evaluation
2. Increase Levetiracetam to 1000mg BID
3. Add Dexamethasone 4mg BID for 7 days to address increased edema
4. Follow-up MRI 3 months after radiosurgery

# NEUROSURGERY TUMOR BOARD NOTE

**DATE:** September 15, 2017
**PATIENT:** Jane Doe
**AGE:** 53
**SEX:** Female

## CASE PRESENTATION
53-year-old female with right parasagittal meningioma initially managed conservatively, then treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in August 2015. Tumor initially responded but now shows progression in size from 3.1 cm to 3.4 cm with increased edema and worsening symptoms.

## MULTIDISCIPLINARY DISCUSSION
**Neurosurgery:** Surgical resection is technically feasible but carries risk of permanent left-sided weakness given location along motor strip. Simpson Grade II resection likely achievable.

**Radiation Oncology:** Re-irradiation is possible but carries increased risk of radiation necrosis. Would recommend waiting at least 2 years from initial radiation course.

**Neuro-oncology:** No proven systemic therapy for meningiomas. Clinical trial options discussed.

**Neuropathology:** Important to obtain tissue for grading as radiographic progression may indicate higher-grade tumor.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Surgical resection recommended given progression after radiation therapy
2. Preoperative functional MRI and tractography to map motor cortex and corticospinal tract
3. Intraoperative motor mapping and monitoring
4. Aim for maximal safe resection with preservation of motor function

# NEUROSURGERY OPERATIVE NOTE

**DATE:** October 20, 2017
**PATIENT:** Jane Doe
**AGE:** 53
**SEX:** Female

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right parasagittal meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right parasagittal meningioma (pathology pending)

## PROCEDURE
Right frontoparietal craniotomy for resection of parasagittal meningioma with intraoperative motor mapping and neuromonitoring

## DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE
After induction of general anesthesia, patient was positioned supine with head fixed in Mayfield pins. Neuronavigation was registered. Right frontoparietal horseshoe incision was made based on preoperative imaging and neuronavigation. Craniotomy was performed exposing the superior sagittal sinus and surrounding dura. Dura was opened in a C-shaped fashion based medially.

Tumor was identified as a firm, well-circumscribed mass with broad attachment to falx and parasagittal dura. Intraoperative motor mapping identified motor cortex posterolateral to tumor. Careful microsurgical technique was used to dissect tumor from surrounding brain tissue. Tumor was internally debulked and then dissected from brain-tumor interface with preservation of pial planes where possible.

Attachment to falx and parasagittal dura was coagulated and resected. Small portion of tumor attachment to superior sagittal sinus was coagulated but left in situ to avoid risk of venous injury (Simpson Grade II resection). Hemostasis was achieved. Dura was closed in watertight fashion. Bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates. Wound was closed in layers.

Intraoperative motor evoked potentials showed transient decrease in amplitude to left lower extremity during manipulation near motor cortex but recovered by end of procedure.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
200 mL

## SPECIMENS
Right parasagittal meningioma sent for pathology

## COMPLICATIONS
None

**Patient:** 43-year-old female
**MRN:** 2476381
**Blood Type:** O
**Attending:** Dr. Sarah Chen, Neurosurgery

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Persistent headaches for 3 months, worsening in the morning and with position changes

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient is a 43-year-old right-handed female who presents with a 3-month history of progressive headaches that are worse in the morning and with position changes. She also reports occasional dizziness, mild visual disturbances in peripheral vision, mild nausea without vomiting, increased fatigue, and slight right-sided facial numbness. The patient notes that these headaches differ from her usual migraine pattern. Due to these symptoms, an MRI was ordered which revealed an incidental finding of a tentorial meningioma.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 8 years ago, currently managed with metformin and lifestyle modifications
- Hypertension controlled with lisinopril
- Migraine headaches since age 25
- Cholecystectomy at age 38
- Family history of breast cancer in mother
- No previous neurological disorders or brain injuries

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Sumatriptan 50mg PRN for migraines
- Multivitamin daily

## SOCIAL HISTORY
Patient works as a high school teacher, which requires significant cognitive function and interpersonal interaction. She lives with her husband and two teenage children. Patient denies smoking and reports occasional alcohol use (1-2 glasses of wine per week). She tries to maintain regular exercise 2-3 times per week but reports this has decreased due to fatigue.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs:** BP 138/82, HR 76, RR 16, Temp 36.7Â°C, O2 Sat 99% on RA

**General:** Alert, oriented x3, in no acute distress

**HEENT:** Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Mild right-sided facial hypoesthesia in V2 distribution. No facial asymmetry.

**Neurological Examination:**
- Mental Status: Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Normal attention and concentration.
- Cranial Nerves: II-XII intact except for decreased sensation in right V2 distribution.
- Motor: 5/5 strength throughout all extremities.
- Sensory: Intact to light touch, temperature, and proprioception except as noted above.
- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric throughout.
- Coordination: Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing normal bilaterally.
- Gait: Normal base, steady, no ataxia.

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast (06/10/2014):** 0.5 cm dural-based homogeneously enhancing lesion along the right tentorial edge, consistent with a small meningioma (WHO Grade I). No significant mass effect on adjacent structures. No perilesional edema.

## ASSESSMENT
43-year-old female with an incidentally discovered 0.5 cm right tentorial meningioma (WHO Grade I). Her headaches may be partially related to the meningioma but could also represent an exacerbation of her migraine disorder, possibly triggered by work-related stress.

## PLAN
1. Given the small size of the meningioma, lack of significant mass effect, and minimal symptomatology directly attributable to the lesion, I recommend a conservative approach with watchful waiting.

2. Follow-up MRI in 6 months to assess for any growth or change in the lesion.

3. Optimize headache management:
   - Neurology referral for headache management
   - Consider prophylactic migraine medication if symptoms persist
   - Maintain headache diary to identify triggers

4. Diabetes management:
   - Continue current regimen
   - Ensure regular follow-up with PCP for diabetes management

5. Patient education regarding meningioma symptoms that would warrant immediate attention (worsening headaches, new focal neurological deficits, seizures, visual changes).

6. Patient advised to avoid excessive physical strain but encouraged to maintain normal daily activities including work.

7. Follow-up appointment in 6 months with repeat imaging prior to visit.

**Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS):** 90 - Able to carry on normal activity; minor symptoms of disease.

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast (March 10, 2019):**
3.8 cm homogeneously enhancing extra-axial mass arising from the right sphenoid wing with extension into the right orbit, causing compression of the right optic nerve and mild mass effect on the right temporal lobe. Findings consistent with sphenoid wing meningioma. Moderate perilesional edema noted.

**CT Head (March 10, 2019):**
Confirms presence of right sphenoid wing mass with hyperostosis of adjacent bone. No evidence of intratumoral calcification.

### ASSESSMENT
57-year-old male data scientist with clinical and radiographic evidence of a right sphenoid wing meningioma (3.8 cm) causing progressive neurological symptoms including headaches, visual field deficits, and facial numbness. Given the tumor's location, size, and symptomatic presentation, surgical intervention is strongly indicated.

### PLAN
1. **Surgical Intervention:** Recommend right frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of sphenoid wing meningioma within the next 2 weeks. Goal is Simpson Grade I-II resection.

2. **Additional Imaging:** Order CT angiogram to evaluate vascular supply and relationship to carotid artery and ophthalmic artery.

3. **Ophthalmology Consultation:** For formal visual field testing and assessment of optic nerve function.

4. **Preoperative Evaluation:** Cardiology clearance given obesity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.

5. **Patient Education:** Discussed risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgical intervention. Emphasized that early intervention is crucial given the tumor's location and impact on vision. Explained that without treatment, progressive visual loss and neurological deterioration are likely.

6. **Follow-up:** Schedule preoperative visit in 1 week to review additional testing and finalize surgical plan.

Patient understands recommendations and agrees to proceed with surgical planning.

Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS): 80 (Normal activity with effort, some signs/symptoms of disease)

## OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date:** March 28, 2019
**Procedure:** Right frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of sphenoid wing meningioma
**Surgeon:** Dr. [Neurosurgeon]

### PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma

### POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma (pending pathology)

### DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head turned to the left and fixed in Mayfield pins. A right frontotemporal curvilinear incision was made. A frontotemporal craniotomy was performed with drilling of the sphenoid wing. The dura was opened, and a well-circumscribed, firm, extra-axial mass was identified arising from the right sphenoid wing with extension into the orbit. The tumor was internally debulked using ultrasonic aspirator. The tumor was carefully dissected from surrounding structures including the optic nerve and carotid artery. Gross total resection was achieved with removal of involved dura and hyperostotic bone (Simpson Grade II). Dural reconstruction performed with pericranial graft. Bone flap replaced and secured with titanium plates. Wound closed in layers.

Estimated blood loss: 350 mL
Complications: None

### PATHOLOGY FINDINGS
**Gross:** Firm, tan-white tissue measuring 3.8 x 3.2 x 2.9 cm.
**Microscopic:** Meningothelial cells arranged in whorls with occasional psammoma bodies. No evidence of brain invasion. Mitotic rate <4 per 10 HPF. Ki-67 proliferation index 3%. Immunohistochemistry positive for EMA and PR.
**Diagnosis:** WHO Grade I Meningioma (Meningothelial subtype)

## RADIATION ONCOLOGY CONSULTATION
**Date:** August 25, 2021
**Patient:** 59-year-old male
**MRN:** MG57031519

### ASSESSMENT
59-year-old male with recurrent right sphenoid wing meningioma (1.2cm) following Simpson Grade II resection in March 2019. Original pathology showed WHO Grade I meningioma, but early recurrence raises concern for potentially more aggressive behavior.

### PLAN
1. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the recurrent tumor
   - Dose: 14 Gy in single fraction
   - Target: 1.2cm enhancing lesion with 2mm margin
   - Critical structures: Right optic nerve, optic chiasm, brainstem

2. Treatment scheduled for September 10, 2021

3. Follow-up MRI in 3 months

---

## GENETIC TESTING RESULTS
**Date:** September 15, 2021
**Patient:** 59-year-old male
**MRN:** MG57031519

### RESULTS
Analysis of the original tumor specimen revealed:
- NF2 mutation (frameshift)
- TERT promoter mutation
- Ki-67 proliferation index higher in focal areas (up to 8%) than originally reported

### INTERPRETATION
The presence of TERT promoter mutation is associated with more aggressive clinical behavior and higher recurrence rates in meningiomas, even in those classified as WHO Grade I by histopathological criteria. This finding explains the early recurrence and suggests the tumor may behave more like a WHO Grade II meningioma.

### PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent right medial sphenoid wing meningioma

### POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent right medial sphenoid wing meningioma (pending pathology)

### DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head turned to the left and fixed in Mayfield pins. The previous right frontotemporal incision was reopened. The previous bone flap was removed. Significant scar tissue was encountered and carefully dissected. A firm, well-circumscribed tumor was identified at the medial sphenoid wing with extension toward the optic canal. The tumor was internally debulked and carefully dissected from surrounding structures including the optic nerve and carotid artery. Gross total resection was achieved (Simpson Grade II). Dural reconstruction performed. Bone flap replaced and secured. Wound closed in layers.

Estimated blood loss: 400 mL
Complications: None

### PATHOLOGY FINDINGS
**Gross:** Firm, tan-white tissue measuring 2.3 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm.
**Microscopic:** Meningothelial cells with increased cellularity compared to original specimen. Brain invasion present. Mitotic rate 6 per 10 HPF. Ki-67 proliferation index 12%. Immunohistochemistry positive for EMA and PR.
**Molecular:** TERT promoter mutation confirmed
**Diagnosis:** WHO Grade II Meningioma (Atypical)

**Date:** March 15, 2014
**Patient:** 68-year-old female
**Occupation:** Librarian/Baker
**Blood Type:** O

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive headaches over 3 months, right-sided weakness, occasional confusion, difficulty finding words, recent falls, visual disturbances (blurry vision in right visual field), morning nausea.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient presents with 3-month history of progressively worsening headaches that have changed in character from her previous migraines. Headaches are now more intense, frequent, and associated with nausea, particularly in the mornings. She reports developing right-sided weakness affecting both arm and leg, occasional confusion, word-finding difficulties, and visual disturbances in the right visual field. Patient has experienced several falls in the past month. Symptoms have been gradually worsening, significantly impacting her ability to work as a librarian and baker.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Hypertension (15 years), managed with lisinopril
- History of migraines, recently changed in character
- Osteoarthritis in both knees
- Total hip replacement 5 years ago
- Breast cancer 12 years ago, treated with lumpectomy and radiation, no recurrence
- Non-smoker
- Occasional alcohol use

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Calcium supplement 1200mg daily
- Vitamin D 1000 IU daily
- Acetaminophen PRN for arthritis pain

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs:** BP 145/90, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 36.8Â°C
**General:** Alert but appears fatigued and in mild distress
**HEENT:** PERRL, right visual field deficit on confrontation testing
**Neurological:**
- Mental Status: Mild confusion, word-finding difficulties
- CN II-XII: Right visual field cut, otherwise intact
- Motor: Right-sided weakness (4/5 in right arm and leg)
- Sensory: Intact to light touch and pinprick
- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric
- Coordination: Mild dysmetria on right
- Gait: Unsteady, favoring right side

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast:** 4.0 cm extra-axial, dural-based mass along the left convexity with homogeneous enhancement, consistent with meningioma. Significant surrounding edema with 5mm midline shift. No evidence of other intracranial lesions.

**CT Head:** Confirms presence of left convexity mass with minimal calcification and adjacent hyperostosis of the calvarium.

## ASSESSMENT
68-year-old female with clinical and radiographic findings consistent with a large left convexity meningioma (WHO Grade I presumed, pending pathology). The location and size of the tumor explain the patient's symptoms, including right-sided weakness, visual field deficit, and headaches. The morning nausea is likely due to increased intracranial pressure.

## PLAN
1. **Surgical Intervention:** Recommend urgent surgical resection with goal of gross total resection. Surgery scheduled for next week.
2. **Pre-operative Management:**
   - Dexamethasone 4mg QID to reduce peritumoral edema
   - Anti-seizure prophylaxis with Levetiracetam 500mg BID
   - Continue current medications except hold calcium on day of surgery
3. **Post-operative Plan:**
   - Admission to neurosurgical ICU for close monitoring
   - Early post-operative MRI to assess extent of resection
   - Comprehensive rehabilitation program
4. **Patient Education:** Discussed risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery. Patient understands and consents to surgical intervention.

## PROGNOSIS
Given the size and location of the meningioma, I anticipate a good outcome with gross total resection. Early intervention is crucial to prevent further neurological decline and to optimize functional recovery.

# NEUROSURGICAL OPERATIVE NOTE

**Date:** March 22, 2014
**Procedure:** Left craniotomy for resection of convexity meningioma

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left convexity meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left convexity meningioma (WHO Grade I - Meningothelial, pending final pathology)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head turned to the right. Neuronavigation was registered. A left-sided horseshoe incision was made, and a craniotomy was performed. Upon opening the dura, a well-circumscribed, firm, highly vascular tumor was identified attached to the dura. Using microsurgical technique, the tumor was carefully dissected from surrounding brain tissue. The dural attachment was coagulated and resected. Gross total resection (Simpson Grade I) was achieved. Dural closure was performed with a synthetic dural graft. Bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates. Wound was closed in layers.

## FINDINGS
4.0 cm well-circumscribed, firm, vascular tumor with dural attachment. No obvious brain invasion. Gross total resection achieved.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
300 mL

## COMPLICATIONS
None

## DISPOSITION
Patient transferred to neurosurgical ICU in stable condition.

**DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:**
- MRI Brain with and without contrast: 3.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma in the left parietal region with significant peritumoral edema, mass effect on the left motor cortex, and midline shift of 5mm.
- CT Head: Confirms location, shows hyperostosis of adjacent skull
- EEG: Focal slowing in the left parietal region with occasional epileptiform discharges

**ASSESSMENT:**
56-year-old female with clinical and radiographic evidence of a 3.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma (WHO Grade I suspected) in the left parietal region. Given her history of childhood cranial radiation, this is likely a radiation-induced meningioma, which carries a higher risk of aggressive behavior and recurrence. Current symptoms are consistent with mass effect and peritumoral edema.

**PLAN:**
1. Recommend urgent surgical resection given:
   - Progressive neurological symptoms
   - Size and location affecting motor function
   - History of radiation exposure (higher risk of aggressive behavior)
   - Occupation requiring high cognitive function

2. Pre-operative management:
   - Start Dexamethasone 4mg QID to reduce peritumoral edema
   - Start Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis
   - Neurocognitive testing to establish baseline
   - Complete pre-operative workup within 1 week

## OPERATIVE NOTE - 05/22/2014

**PROCEDURE:** Left parietal craniotomy for resection of parasagittal/falx meningioma

**PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Left parasagittal/falx meningioma

**POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Left parasagittal/falx meningioma, suspected WHO Grade I

**SURGEON:** Dr. [Redacted]

**ANESTHESIA:** General endotracheal

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:** 350 mL

**COMPLICATIONS:** None

**DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:**
After appropriate positioning and preparation, a left parietal craniotomy was performed. Upon dural opening, a well-circumscribed, firm, highly vascular tumor was identified attached to the falx cerebri. The tumor was carefully dissected from surrounding brain parenchyma using microsurgical techniques. Special attention was given to preserving the draining veins. The tumor was removed en bloc with its dural attachment. Simpson Grade II resection was achieved due to involvement of the superior sagittal sinus, which was left intact to avoid venous compromise. Hemostasis was obtained. Dura was closed in a watertight fashion. Bone flap was replaced and secured. Wound was closed in layers. Patient tolerated the procedure well.

**PATHOLOGY:** Specimen sent for histopathological examination.

------------------------------------------------------------

## PATHOLOGY REPORT - 05/25/2014

**SPECIMEN:** Left parasagittal/falx mass

**GROSS DESCRIPTION:** 3.2 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm firm, tan-white, well-circumscribed mass.

**MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:**
Sections show a meningothelial neoplasm with whorled architecture, psammoma bodies, and uniform nuclei with occasional intranuclear inclusions. No significant mitotic activity (1 per 10 HPF). No necrosis or brain invasion identified.

**IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:**
- Positive: EMA, vimentin, progesterone receptor
- Ki-67 proliferation index: 3%
- Negative: SSTR2

**MOLECULAR STUDIES:**
- NF2 mutation detected
- TERT promoter mutation negative
- No evidence of chromosome 22q loss

**DIAGNOSIS:** WHO Grade I meningioma (meningothelial type)
**NOTE:** History of prior radiation exposure increases risk for progression and recurrence despite benign histological features.

57-year-old female with evidence of recurrent meningioma at primary site and new satellite lesion 15 months after initial resection. Given her history of radiation exposure, this rapid recurrence is concerning for potentially more aggressive behavior despite initial WHO Grade I pathology.

**PLAN:**
1. Recommend reoperation for resection of recurrent tumors
2. Start Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis given transient weakness episodes
3. Complete pre-operative workup
4. Surgery scheduled for 10/02/2015
5. Will consider adjuvant radiation therapy post-operatively given the rapid recurrence

**CURRENT MEDICATIONS:**
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Levetiracetam 500mg BID
- Dexamethasone 4mg BID (started today)

**KPS Score: 80** - Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease.

------------------------------------------------------------

## OPERATIVE NOTE - 10/02/2015

**PROCEDURE:** Left parietal re-craniotomy for resection of recurrent parasagittal/falx meningiomas

**PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Recurrent left parasagittal/falx meningiomas

**POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Recurrent left parasagittal/falx meningiomas

**SURGEON:** Dr. [Redacted]

**ANESTHESIA:** General endotracheal

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:** 400 mL

**COMPLICATIONS:** None

**DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:**
Previous craniotomy site was reopened. Two distinct tumors were identified: a 1.2 cm recurrent tumor at the primary site and a 0.8 cm satellite lesion. Both tumors demonstrated significant dural attachment. Simpson Grade II resection was achieved for both lesions. The superior sagittal sinus was preserved. Intraoperative frozen section of the primary recurrence suggested increased mitotic activity compared to the original pathology. Hemostasis was obtained. Dura was closed in a watertight fashion. Bone flap was replaced and secured. Wound was closed in layers.

**PATHOLOGY:** Specimens sent for histopathological examination.

------------------------------------------------------------

## PATHOLOGY REPORT - 10/05/2015

**SPECIMEN:** Recurrent left parasagittal/falx masses (2)

**MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:**
Both lesions show a meningothelial neoplasm with increased cellularity compared to the previous specimen. Tumor cells demonstrate nuclear atypia and prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures increased to 5-7 per 10 HPF. Small foci of necrosis are present. Brain invasion is identified in the larger specimen.

**IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:**
- Positive: EMA, vimentin, progesterone receptor
- Ki-67 proliferation index: 12% (increased from 3% in prior specimen)
- Negative: SSTR2

**MOLECULAR STUDIES:**
- NF2 mutation detected (same as original tumor)
- TERT promoter mutation positive (not present in original tumor)
- Evidence of chromosome 1p and 14q loss (not present in original tumor)

**DIAGNOSIS:** WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma with brain invasion

**COMMENT:** The histological progression to WHO Grade II, acquisition of TERT promoter mutation, and chromosomal alterations not present in the original tumor suggest significant biological progression, likely influenced by the patient's history of radiation exposure.

------------------------------------------------------------

## POST-OPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP - 10/16/2015

**SUBJECTIVE:**
Patient reports improvement in headaches. Right-sided weakness persists but is stable. No seizures since surgery. Reports significant fatigue.

**OBJECTIVE:**
- Vital Signs: Within normal limits
- Neurological:
  - Motor: Right upper extremity 4+/5, right lower extremity 5-/5
  - Right facial droop unchanged
  - Left homonymous hemianopsia unchanged

**DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:**
Post-operative MRI shows gross total resection of both tumors with expected post-surgical changes.

**ASSESSMENT:**
57-year-old female status post resection of recurrent WHO Grade II (atypical) meningiomas. Histological progression from Grade I to Grade II is concerning, as is the rapid recurrence and development of a satellite lesion. Given her history of radiation exposure and the newly acquired molecular alterations, she is at high risk for further recurrence.

**PLAN:**
1. Refer for adjuvant radiation therapy given:
   - Progression to WHO Grade II
   - Rapid recurrence
   - History of radiation exposure
   - Acquisition of TERT promoter mutation
2. Continue Levetiracetam 500mg BID
3. Dexamethasone taper over 2 weeks
4. Follow-up MRI in 3 months, then every 4 months
5. Return to clinic after completion of radiation therapy

**CURRENT MEDICATIONS:**
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Levetiracetam 500mg BID
- Dexamethasone (tapering schedule)
- Omeprazole 20mg daily
- Acetaminophen PRN for pain

**KPS Score: 70** - Cares for self but unable to carry on normal activity or do active work.

------------------------------------------------------------

## RADIATION ONCOLOGY CONSULTATION - 10/23/2015

**ASSESSMENT:**
57-year-old female with recurrent WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma status post two resections. Given the rapid recurrence, progression in grade, and concerning molecular features, adjuvant radiation therapy is strongly recommended.

**PLAN:**
1. Fractionated external beam radiation therapy to the tumor bed plus 2 cm margin
2. Total dose: 54 Gy in 30 fractions (1.8 Gy per fraction)
3. Treatment to begin on 11/02/2015
4. Weekly on-treatment visits
5. MRI brain with and without contrast at 3 months post-completion

------------------------------------------------------------

## FOLLOW-UP VISIT - 03/10/2016

**SUBJECTIVE:**
Patient completed radiation therapy on 12/14/2015. Reports significant fatigue and intermittent headaches. Has been unable to return to work. Experienced one seizure in February despite medication compliance. Reports worsening right-sided weakness over the past month.

**OBJECTIVE:**
- Vital Signs: BP 142/88, HR 82, RR 18
- Neurological:
  - Motor: Right upper extremity 4-/5, right lower extremity 4/5 (decline from previous)
  - Right facial droop more pronounced
  - Left homonymous hemianopsia unchanged
  - New mild dysarthria

**DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:**
MRI shows two new enhancing lesions: a 1.5 cm lesion at the original tumor site and a 1.0 cm lesion along the falx cerebri. Significant FLAIR hyperintensity surrounding both lesions suggests a combination of radiation effect and tumor progression.

**ASSESSMENT:**
57-year-old female with multiple recurrent meningiomas despite surgery and radiation therapy. Disease progression suggests increasingly aggressive behavior. Given the short interval to recurrence after radiation therapy, this represents a challenging clinical scenario.

**PLAN:**
1. Neurosurgical re-evaluation for possible third operation
2. Increase Levetiracetam to 750mg BID
3. Start Dexamethasone 4mg BID
4. Molecular tumor board discussion to evaluate potential targeted therapy options
5. Consider enrollment in clinical trials
6. MRI in 6 weeks to assess response to steroids and distinguish radiation effect from tumor progression
7. Disability paperwork completion as patient is unable to return to work

**CURRENT MEDICATIONS:**
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Levetiracetam 750mg BID
- Dexamethasone 4mg BID
- Omeprazole 20mg daily
- Acetaminophen PRN for pain

**KPS Score: 60** - Requires occasional assistance but is able to care for most personal needs.

------------------------------------------------------------

## MOLECULAR TUMOR BOARD - 03/17/2016

**DISCUSSION:**
Review of the patient's tumor molecular profile shows NF2 mutation, TERT promoter mutation, and loss of chromosomes 1p and 14q. These features, combined with the radiation-induced etiology and rapid progression despite multimodal therapy, indicate a highly aggressive phenotype.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. Consider bevacizumab for anti-angiogenic effects (off-label)
2. Potential for mTOR inhibitor (everolimus) based on NF2 mutation
3. Clinical trial enrollment recommended if eligible
4. Re-biopsy at next surgery to reassess molecular profile and grade

------------------------------------------------------------

## FOLLOW-UP VISIT - 04/25/2016

Final KPS Score: 0","# CLINICAL NOTES - NEUROSURGERY DEPARTMENT

## INITIAL CONSULTATION - 03/15/2014

**PATIENT**: Sarah Johnson
**AGE/SEX**: 56/F
**BLOOD TYPE**: O
**OCCUPATION**: Software Developer
**MRN**: 458721

**CHIEF COMPLAINT**:
Progressive headaches over 3 months, right-sided weakness, occasional seizures, difficulty concentrating at work, mild personality changes, visual disturbances including blurred vision in the left visual field.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**:
Patient presents with 3-month history of worsening headaches, described as dull, persistent, and more severe in the morning. She reports 2 episodes of seizures in the past month, characterized by right arm jerking followed by brief confusion. Patient notes increasing difficulty with concentration affecting her work as a software developer. Family members have noticed mild personality changes, describing her as more irritable and withdrawn. Visual symptoms include intermittent blurring in the left visual field.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY**:
- Radiation therapy to the head for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia at age 12
- Migraines since age 30
- Hypertension, controlled with medication
- Surgical removal of basal cell carcinoma from nose 5 years ago
- Family history of breast cancer (mother)

**CURRENT MEDICATIONS**:
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Sumatriptan PRN for migraines
- Multivitamin daily

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION**:
- Vital Signs: BP 138/82, HR 76, RR 16, Temp 98.6Â°F
- General: Alert, oriented x3, mild discomfort due to headache
- HEENT: PERRL, fundoscopic exam shows mild papilledema
- Neurological: 
  - Right-sided weakness (4/5 strength in right arm and leg)
  - Subtle right facial droop
  - Left homonymous hemianopsia on confrontation testing
  - Reflexes 2+ and symmetric

**DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES**:
- MRI Brain w/ and w/o contrast: 3.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma with surrounding edema, causing mass effect on the motor cortex
- CT Head: Confirms location, shows no calcification
- EEG: Focal slowing over the left frontoparietal region, no epileptiform activity

**ASSESSMENT**:
56-year-old female with a 3.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma, likely WHO Grade I based on imaging characteristics. Given her history of childhood cranial radiation, this represents a probable radiation-induced meningioma, which confers a higher risk profile despite benign appearance. Patient's symptoms are consistent with the tumor location affecting the motor cortex.

**PLAN**:
After thorough discussion of management options including surgical resection versus conservative management, we have opted for a watchful waiting approach with the following plan:

1. Anti-seizure medication: Levetiracetam 500mg BID to control seizures
2. Dexamethasone 4mg BID with taper to control cerebral edema and improve symptoms
3. Serial imaging: Repeat MRI in 3 months to assess stability or growth
4. Neuropsychological evaluation to establish baseline cognitive function
5. Occupational therapy referral to address workplace accommodations
6. Patient to maintain seizure diary and headache log
7. Provided education on seizure precautions and when to seek emergency care

Patient understands the risks and benefits of conservative management versus surgery. Given her history of radiation exposure and the location of the tumor, conservative management with close monitoring is reasonable at this time. Surgery would be recommended if there is significant tumor growth, worsening symptoms despite medical management, or signs of malignant transformation.

**WHO GRADE**: Presumed Grade I meningioma (based on imaging characteristics)

After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned in right lateral position with head fixed in Mayfield pins. Neuronavigation was registered. A left parietal craniotomy was performed. Transcortical approach through the superior parietal lobule was utilized to access the lateral ventricle. Upon entering the ventricle, a highly vascular mass was identified. The tumor was more adherent to surrounding structures than the previous tumor. Near-total resection was achieved with small residual adherent to choroid plexus to avoid vascular injury. External ventricular drain was placed. Dura was closed in watertight fashion. Bone flap secured with titanium plates. Wound closed in layers.

**DISPOSITION**: Patient transferred to Neurosurgical ICU in stable condition.

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

This 42-year-old female data scientist presented in 2014 with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure due to a 3.2 cm intraventricular meningioma (WHO Grade I, presumptive). Given the deep location of the tumor and the risks associated with surgical intervention, a conservative management approach was initially adopted with medical management of symptoms.

After demonstrating tumor growth despite medical management, the patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery in December 2016. She showed an excellent response to SRS with gradual tumor shrinkage from 3.7 cm to 2.5 cm over the following years, with no evidence of progression since 2021.

The patient has been successfully weaned off all neurological medications and currently maintains a normal lifestyle with full-time employment and no neurological deficits. Her case demonstrates the effectiveness of a watchful waiting approach with timely intervention using SRS when indicated, avoiding the risks of open surgical resection for a deep-seated intraventricular meningioma.

**Current KPS Score**: 100 - Normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease."

Upon dural opening, the frontal and temporal lobes were gently retracted to expose the suprasellar region. The tumor was identified, appearing as a firm, vascular mass compressing the optic apparatus. Microsurgical techniques were employed to carefully dissect the tumor away from critical neurovascular structures. 

The tumor was debulked internally using ultrasonic aspiration, followed by careful dissection of the tumor capsule from the optic chiasm and nerves. The portion of tumor extending into the right cavernous sinus was firmly adherent to the internal carotid artery and could not be safely removed. Simpson Grade II resection was achieved for the main tumor mass, with residual tumor left in the cavernous sinus. Hemostasis was obtained, and the dura was closed in a watertight fashion. The bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates. The wound was closed in layers.

**PATHOLOGY:** Specimens sent for histopathological examination and genetic analysis.

**COMPLICATIONS:** None

**ESTIMATED DEGREE OF RESECTION:** Simpson Grade II (complete macroscopic removal with coagulation of dural attachment); residual tumor in cavernous sinus.

## OPERATIVE NOTE - 11/30/2015

**PROCEDURE:** Repeat right frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of recurrent meningioma

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Recurrent meningioma, planum sphenoidale and cavernous sinus

**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Recurrent meningioma, planum sphenoidale and cavernous sinus

**SURGEON:** Dr. Michael Reynolds

**ANESTHESIA:** General endotracheal

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:** 600 mL

**OPERATIVE FINDINGS:**
New firm tumor mass at the planum sphenoidale with significant adherence to the dura. Enlarged residual tumor in the cavernous sinus with increased vascularity.

**DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:**
Previous craniotomy site was reopened and extended. The dura was opened to expose the planum sphenoidale lesion, which was found to be firmly adherent to the surrounding dura. The tumor was carefully dissected and removed using microsurgical techniques. Attempts were made to reduce the cavernous sinus component, but complete removal was not possible due to critical neurovascular structures. Simpson Grade II resection was achieved for the planum sphenoidale lesion, while the cavernous sinus component was debulked (Simpson Grade IV). Hemostasis was obtained, and the dura was closed. The bone flap was replaced and the wound closed in layers.

**PATHOLOGY:** Specimens sent for histopathological examination and genetic analysis.

**COMPLICATIONS:** None

## PATHOLOGY REPORT - 12/04/2015

**SPECIMEN:** Recurrent meningioma, planum sphenoidale

**GROSS DESCRIPTION:**
Multiple fragments of firm, tan-white tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm in aggregate.

**MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:**
Sections show a meningothelial neoplasm with areas of increased cellularity and sheet-like growth. Increased mitotic activity (6 mitoses per 10 high-power fields) is present. Small foci of necrosis are identified. No brain invasion seen.

**IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:**
- Positive for EMA and progesterone receptor
- Ki-67 proliferation index: 12% (increased from 4% in previous specimen)
- Negative for CD34 and STAT6

**GENETIC ANALYSIS:**
- Persistent NF2 gene mutation
- Monosomy 22
- New TERT promoter mutation detected
- Additional chromosome 1p and 14q deletions

**DIAGNOSIS:**
WHO Grade II Atypical Meningioma

**COMMENT:**
The histological features show progression from the previous WHO Grade I to WHO Grade II atypical meningioma. The increased Ki-67 proliferation index, presence of necrosis, increased mitotic activity, and additional genetic alterations (TERT promoter mutation, 1p and 14q deletions) suggest more aggressive biological behavior. This progression is consistent with the clinical history of radiation-induced meningioma.

# NEUROSURGICAL OPERATIVE NOTE

**DATE: June 27, 2022**
**PATIENT**: Jane Doe
**PROCEDURE**: Right pterional craniotomy for resection of sphenoid wing meningioma

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma, WHO Grade I (presumed)

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma, WHO Grade II (pending pathology)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head fixed in Mayfield pins. A right pterional approach was utilized. A curvilinear incision was made, and a craniotomy was performed. The dura was opened. Using microsurgical technique, the sphenoid wing meningioma was identified. The tumor appeared more vascular and infiltrative than typical Grade I meningiomas. Due to involvement of the cavernous sinus medially, a subtotal resection was achieved (Simpson Grade III). The portion threatening the optic apparatus was completely removed. Hemostasis was obtained. The dura was closed. The bone flap was secured with titanium plates. The temporalis muscle, galea, and skin were closed in layers.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
300 mL

## COMPLICATIONS
None

## PATHOLOGY
Specimen sent for histopathological examination.

## PLAN
1. Routine post-craniotomy care
2. Dexamethasone taper over 10 days

# OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date:** April 10, 2015
**Patient:** Jane Doe
**Age:** 45
**Gender:** Female

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left parasagittal/falx meningioma, WHO Grade I (presumed)

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left parasagittal/falx meningioma, WHO Grade II (atypical) by frozen section

## PROCEDURE
Left parietal craniotomy for resection of parasagittal/falx meningioma

## SURGEON
Dr. Sarah Johnson

## ANESTHESIA
General endotracheal

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
450 mL

## COMPLICATIONS
None

## DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was positioned supine with head pinned in Mayfield fixation. Neuronavigation was registered. A left parietal horseshoe incision was made. Craniotomy was performed crossing the midline to expose the superior sagittal sinus.

Upon dural opening, a firm, well-circumscribed, highly vascular tumor was identified along the falx with extension into the left parietal region. The tumor demonstrated significant invasion of the superior sagittal sinus. Intraoperative ultrasound was used to define tumor margins.

Tumor debulking was performed from within using ultrasonic aspirator. The tumor was noted to be moderately firm in consistency. Portions invading the superior sagittal sinus were left intentionally to preserve venous drainage. Specimens were sent for frozen section, which suggested atypical features consistent with WHO Grade II meningioma.

Simpson Grade II resection was achieved for the main tumor mass. Hemostasis was obtained. Dural closure was performed with a pericranial graft. Bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates. Wound was closed in layers.

Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Neuromonitoring showed transient changes in motor evoked potentials in the right lower extremity during tumor manipulation near the motor strip, which partially recovered by the end of the procedure.

## PLAN
1. Transfer to Neurosurgical ICU for post-operative monitoring
2. Routine post-operative care
3. Continue dexamethasone and levetiracetam
4. Early physical therapy and rehabilitation
5. Await final pathology report

- Motor: 3/5 strength in right lower extremity, 4/5 in right upper extremity
- Sensory: Decreased sensation in right lower extremity
- Reflexes: 3+ on right, 2+ on left
- Gait: Ambulates with quad cane

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain (05/22/2015):** Postoperative changes in the left parietal region. Small residual enhancing tissue along the falx and superior sagittal sinus, measuring approximately 1.2 x 0.8 cm, consistent with residual tumor. No evidence of recurrent tumor at the resection site.

## ASSESSMENT
45-year-old female with WHO Grade II (atypical) radiation-induced meningioma status post Simpson Grade II resection with small residual tumor along the superior sagittal sinus.

## PLAN
1. Given the WHO Grade II histology, residual tumor, and radiation-induced nature of the meningioma, I recommend adjuvant radiation therapy.

2. However, considering the patient's prior history of cranial radiation and preference for conservative management where possible, we have discussed the option of close surveillance as an alternative approach.

3. After thorough discussion of risks and benefits, patient prefers to pursue close surveillance initially rather than immediate adjuvant radiation.

4. Surveillance plan:
   - MRI brain every 3 months for the first year
   - If stable, MRI every 4-6 months for the second year
   - Consider radiation at first sign of progression

5. Continue to taper dexamethasone with goal to discontinue within 2 weeks.

6. Continue levetiracetam 1000mg BID for seizure prophylaxis.

7. Referral to genetic counseling given history of radiation-induced meningioma.

8. Discussed signs and symptoms that would warrant urgent evaluation.

# GENETIC COUNSELING CONSULTATION
**Date:** September 15, 2015
**Patient:** Jane Doe
**Age:** 45
**Gender:** Female

## REASON FOR CONSULTATION
Evaluation of genetic risk factors in patient with radiation-induced atypical meningioma.

## FAMILY HISTORY
- Mother: Breast cancer at age 62, alive
- Father: Hypertension, alive at 72
- Sister: Healthy, age 48
- Brother: Healthy, age 42
- No known family history of brain tumors or neurological disorders

## PERSONAL HISTORY
- Radiation therapy to the head for childhood tinea capitis at age 8
- Diagnosed with atypical meningioma at age 44
- No other malignancies

## GENETIC TESTING RESULTS
Comprehensive germline testing for hereditary cancer syndromes, including NF2, SMARCB1, LZTR1, SMARCE1, BAP1, SUFU, and TP53 genes, revealed no pathogenic variants.

## ASSESSMENT
Patient's meningioma is most consistent with radiation-induced etiology rather than a hereditary cancer syndrome. The molecular profile from tumor tissue (NF2 mutation, TERT promoter mutation, monosomy 22) is consistent with radiation-induced meningioma.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. No evidence of hereditary cancer syndrome requiring additional surveillance at this time.

2. First-degree relatives are not at increased genetic risk for meningioma based on current findings.

3. Recommend continued surveillance per neuro-oncology protocol due to increased risk of additional CNS tumors related to prior radiation exposure.

4. Consider participation in research studies focused on radiation-induced meningiomas.

**Patient**: 62-year-old female, blood type A
**Occupation**: Librarian
**Pregnancy Status**: 24 weeks (second trimester)

## PRESENTING COMPLAINTS
- Persistent headaches for 3 months, gradually increasing in intensity
- Occasional dizziness
- Recent onset of mild right leg weakness
- One episode of seizure two weeks ago
- Difficulty concentrating while reading

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Hypertension controlled with lisinopril 10mg daily
- History of migraine headaches since age 30 (pattern has changed recently)
- Surgical removal of ovarian cyst 10 years ago
- No prior neurological disorders
- Family history of breast cancer (mother)
- No prior radiation exposure

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Prenatal vitamins
- Occasional acetaminophen for headaches

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
- Vital signs: BP 132/84, HR 78, RR 16, T 36.7Â°C
- Neurological examination:
  - Alert and oriented x3
  - Cranial nerves II-XII intact
  - Mild (4+/5) weakness in right lower extremity
  - Reflexes 2+ and symmetric throughout
  - Sensation intact to light touch and pinprick
  - Negative Babinski bilaterally
  - Gait with slight favoring of right leg

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
- MRI Brain (performed today): 0.5cm parasagittal/falx meningioma, WHO Grade I, with minimal surrounding edema. No evidence of invasion of adjacent structures.
- EEG: Mild focal slowing over left frontal region. No epileptiform discharges.
- Basic laboratory studies: Within normal limits.

## ASSESSMENT
62-year-old pregnant female (24 weeks) with newly diagnosed 0.5cm parasagittal/falx meningioma, WHO Grade I. Symptoms likely related to meningioma, with seizure possibly due to irritation of adjacent cortex. Right leg weakness correlates with location of lesion.

## PLAN
Given the patient's pregnancy status, small tumor size, and relatively mild symptoms, I recommend a conservative watchful waiting approach:

1. **Neurological monitoring**: Follow-up in 1 month, then quarterly during pregnancy
2. **Anti-seizure management**: Start levetiracetam 500mg BID (pregnancy category C, but safer option)
3. **Headache management**: Continue acetaminophen as needed; avoid NSAIDs
4. **Imaging**: Repeat MRI after delivery (approximately August 2014)
5. **Pregnancy management**: Close coordination with OB/GYN
6. **Work accommodations**: Recommend reduced hours at library, particularly limiting tasks requiring prolonged concentration
7. **Patient education**: Discussed signs/symptoms requiring immediate attention (worsening headaches, vision changes, increased weakness, recurrent seizures)

Patient understands that surgical intervention would be considered only if significant neurological deterioration occurs during pregnancy. Otherwise, we will reassess after delivery.

## ASSESSMENT
44-year-old female with a 3.8 cm foramen magnum meningioma (WHO Grade I presumed), causing progressive neurological symptoms including neck pain, occipital headaches, bilateral upper extremity weakness and sensory changes, gait instability, and lower cranial nerve dysfunction.

## PLAN
After thorough discussion with the patient regarding management options including surgical resection versus conservative management, we have decided to pursue a watchful waiting approach with close monitoring, given the following considerations:

1. Patient's preference to avoid surgery if possible due to concerns about surgical risks in this critical location
2. Occupation as a teacher requiring significant time off if surgery were pursued
3. Relatively stable symptoms that are manageable with conservative measures

### Recommendations:
1. **Monitoring:**
   - Follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess for any growth
   - Clinical evaluation every 3 months initially

2. **Symptomatic Management:**
   - Cervical collar for neck pain and stability
   - Physical therapy referral for neck strengthening and gait training
   - Occupational therapy for upper extremity function and adaptation strategies for classroom activities

3. **Medications:**
   - Continue lisinopril 10mg daily
   - Acetaminophen 500mg q6h PRN for pain
   - Meclizine 25mg PRN for vertigo

4. **Education:**
   - Patient educated on red flag symptoms that would warrant immediate medical attention: severe headache, visual changes, increased weakness, difficulty breathing or swallowing, altered mental status
   - Discussion about potential for future intervention if symptoms worsen or tumor demonstrates significant growth

5. **Work Modifications:**
   - Letter provided for workplace accommodations: reduced standing time, assistance with supervision duties, modified teaching schedule

Patient verbalizes understanding of the plan and agrees to close follow-up. She has been provided with contact information for urgent concerns.

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Foramen magnum meningioma with progressive neurological symptoms

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Foramen magnum meningioma (WHO Grade I, meningothelial subtype confirmed by frozen section)

## PROCEDURE PERFORMED
Suboccipital craniectomy, C1 laminectomy, and Simpson Grade II resection of foramen magnum meningioma

## ANESTHESIA
General endotracheal anesthesia

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
350 mL

## COMPLICATIONS
None

## SURGICAL FINDINGS
- 4.5 cm extra-axial, dural-based meningioma at the foramen magnum
- Tumor was firm, well-circumscribed, and moderately vascular
- Significant compression of medulla and upper cervical cord
- Tumor origin from dura of the anterior rim of foramen magnum
- Lower cranial nerves (IX, X, XI, XII) were displaced but intact

## PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION
The patient was positioned prone in Mayfield pins with the neck flexed. After standard preparation and draping, a midline incision was made from the inion to C2. Suboccipital muscles were dissected and retracted laterally. Suboccipital craniectomy and C1 laminectomy were performed. The dura was opened in a Y-shaped fashion.

Upon dural opening, the tumor was immediately visualized. It was firm, moderately vascular, and compressing the medulla and upper cervical cord. Internal debulking was performed using ultrasonic aspirator. The tumor was carefully dissected from the lower cranial nerves and brainstem using microsurgical technique. The tumor origin was identified at the anterior rim of foramen magnum. A Simpson Grade II resection was achieved with coagulation of the dural attachment.

Hemostasis was obtained. Dural closure was performed with a dural substitute and fibrin sealant to ensure watertight closure. The wound was closed in layers. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the neurosurgical ICU in stable condition.

## SPECIMENS
Foramen magnum meningioma tissue sent for permanent pathology.

## PLAN
1. Neurosurgical ICU monitoring overnight
2. Postoperative MRI within 24 hours
3. Early mobilization as tolerated
4. Speech and swallowing evaluation
5. Physical therapy and occupational therapy consultations

**PROCEDURE**: Right parasagittal craniotomy for resection of meningioma

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right parasagittal meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right parasagittal meningioma, WHO Grade II (atypical)

## DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head fixed in Mayfield pins. A parasagittal craniotomy was performed. Upon dural opening, a firm, well-circumscribed tumor was identified attached to the falx. The tumor was debulked internally, and then dissected from surrounding brain tissue. Due to significant attachment to the superior sagittal sinus, a small portion (approximately 1cmÂ²) of tumor was left attached to preserve venous drainage. Estimated Simpson Grade II resection achieved. Hemostasis obtained. Dura closed in watertight fashion. Bone flap replaced and secured. Wound closed in layers.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
350 mL

## MANAGEMENT PLAN
After discussing treatment options with the patient, we have decided to pursue a conservative management approach with watchful waiting strategy given:
1. Patient's age and comorbidities
2. Moderate size of tumor
3. Mild symptoms that may be manageable with medication

Treatment plan:
1. Continue Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis
2. Start Dexamethasone 4mg BID for 5 days, then taper to 2mg BID for 5 days, then 2mg daily for 5 days to reduce perilesional edema
3. Follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess tumor stability
4. Optimize blood pressure control with potential adjustment of anti-hypertensive medication
5. Physical therapy evaluation for gait instability
6. Lifestyle modifications to address obesity - referral to nutritionist

Given patient's occupation as a baker, which requires standing for prolonged periods and manual dexterity, we've discussed potential workplace accommodations including:
- More frequent rest breaks
- Avoiding heavy lifting (>10 lbs)
- Considering part-time work schedule if symptoms worsen

Patient understands the rationale for conservative management and agrees to close monitoring.

**Attending Neurosurgeon**: Dr. Morgan Williams

## PRESENTING SYMPTOMS
Patient presents with progressively worsening headaches over the past 3 months, right-sided proptosis, decreased visual acuity in right eye, occasional diplopia, facial numbness on right side, and mild difficulty with concentration. Headaches described as ""pressure-like"" and most severe in the morning.

## MEDICAL HISTORY
- Hypertension diagnosed 6 years ago, controlled with lisinopril
- Class II obesity (BMI 37)
- History of migraine without aura since age 25
- Tonsillectomy at age 12
- No prior neurological disorders
- No history of radiation exposure
- Family history negative for brain tumors
- Taking oral contraceptives for 15 years until age 45

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Sumatriptan 50mg PRN for migraines

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
- Vital signs: BP 138/85, HR 76, RR 16, Temp 37.0Â°C
- General: Alert, oriented x3, obese female in no acute distress
- HEENT: Right-sided proptosis, decreased right pupillary reaction
- Neurological: Decreased sensation over right V1-V2 distribution, decreased visual acuity right eye (20/70), full extraocular movements with occasional diplopia on right lateral gaze, remainder of cranial nerves intact. Motor and sensory exam normal in extremities.

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast (03/12/2014)**: 4.2 cm extra-axial mass arising from the right sphenoid wing with homogeneous enhancement, dural tail, and significant mass effect on the right temporal lobe. Moderate perilesional edema. Findings consistent with sphenoid wing meningioma.

**CT Head (03/13/2014)**: Confirms right sphenoid wing mass with hyperostosis of adjacent bone. No evidence of intratumoral calcification.

**Visual field testing**: Right temporal hemianopsia noted.

## IMPRESSION
48-year-old female with a 4.2 cm right sphenoid wing meningioma (WHO Grade I suspected, pending pathology), causing significant mass effect and visual compromise.

## TREATMENT PLAN
1. Recommend urgent surgical resection via right pterional craniotomy with goal of maximal safe resection
2. Surgery scheduled for March 20, 2014
3. Preoperative optimization of blood pressure
4. Dexamethasone 4mg q6h to reduce perilesional edema starting immediately
5. Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis
6. Ophthalmology consult for baseline assessment
7. Detailed discussion of surgical risks including visual deterioration, oculomotor dysfunction, facial numbness, CSF leak, infection, and stroke
8. Patient to be typed and screened for possible transfusion (Blood type O)

## RATIONALE FOR EARLY INTERVENTION
Given the patient's progressive visual symptoms, proptosis, and size of the tumor with mass effect, early surgical intervention is strongly recommended. The location at the sphenoid wing with involvement of the optic apparatus warrants aggressive management to prevent further visual deterioration. Patient's occupation as a high school teacher requires preserved cognitive function and visual acuity.

Patient understands risks and benefits of surgical intervention and wishes to proceed with surgery as recommended.

**Surgeon**: Dr. Morgan Williams

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma, WHO Grade II (atypical features on frozen section)

## PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION
After general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head turned to the left. A right pterional craniotomy was performed. Upon dural opening, a firm, vascular, extra-axial mass was identified arising from the right sphenoid wing with extension into the orbit. The tumor was noted to have significant hyperostosis of the sphenoid wing. Simpson Grade II resection was achieved with coagulation of dural attachment. The hyperostotic bone was drilled extensively. Tumor was noted to have some adherence to the right optic nerve and cavernous sinus medially, where a small amount of tumor was left to preserve neurovascular structures. Dural closure was performed with duraplasty. Bone flap was replaced and secured.

Estimated blood loss: 350cc
Complications: None

## PATHOLOGY (PRELIMINARY)
Atypical meningioma (WHO Grade II) with increased mitotic activity (5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields), sheeting architecture, and prominent nucleoli. Ki-67 proliferation index of 9%. Immunohistochemistry positive for EMA and PR. No evidence of frank anaplasia or brain invasion.

## POSTOPERATIVE PLAN
1. Admit to Neurosurgical ICU for close monitoring
2. Continue dexamethasone with taper

## OPERATIVE NOTE - 11/28/2018

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Recurrent left frontal convexity meningioma

**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Recurrent left frontal convexity meningioma, WHO Grade III (anaplastic) pending final pathology

**PROCEDURE PERFORMED:** Second revision left frontoparietal craniotomy for resection of recurrent meningioma

**SURGEON:** Dr. Michael Reynolds

**ANESTHESIA:** General endotracheal

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:** 650 mL

**COMPLICATIONS:** None

**SURGICAL FINDINGS:**
- 3.1 cm highly vascular, infiltrative extra-axial mass
- Tumor showed significant invasion into brain parenchyma
- Extensive scarring from previous surgeries and radiation
- Simpson Grade III resection achieved due to invasive nature

**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**
Previous incision was reopened. Significant scarring was encountered throughout the surgical field. Upon dural opening, the recurrent tumor was identified and appeared significantly more aggressive and infiltrative than during previous surgeries. The tumor was internally debulked, but clear margins were difficult to establish due to invasion into surrounding brain tissue. Aggressive debulking was performed to achieve maximal safe resection. Areas of tumor adherent to critical structures were coagulated but not completely removed. Hemostasis was achieved with difficulty due to tumor vascularity. Dural closure was performed with a synthetic dural substitute. Bone flap was replaced and secured. Wound was closed in layers. Simpson Grade III resection was achieved.

**FROZEN SECTION:** Concerning for WHO Grade III (anaplastic) meningioma

**DISPOSITION:** Patient was transferred to the Neurosurgical ICU in stable condition for post-operative monitoring.

## ASSESSMENT
45-year-old female with:
1. Newly diagnosed 5.4 cm left convexity meningioma (likely WHO Grade I) causing progressive neurological symptoms including headaches, right-sided weakness, seizures, and visual field deficits
2. Type 2 diabetes, moderately controlled
3. Hypertension, suboptimally controlled

## PLAN
After thorough discussion with the patient regarding management options including surgery, radiation therapy, and observation, we have decided to pursue a conservative approach with watchful waiting given her preference to avoid surgery if possible and the typical slow growth pattern of meningiomas.

1. **Symptomatic Management:**
   - Increase Levetiracetam to 750mg BID for seizure control
   - Dexamethasone 4mg BID for 5 days, then taper to 2mg BID for 5 days, then 2mg daily for 5 days, then discontinue to reduce peritumoral edema
   - Pantoprazole 40mg daily while on dexamethasone

2. **Monitoring Plan:**
   - Follow-up MRI in 3 months to establish growth rate
   - Neurosurgery clinic follow-up in 3 months with repeat neurological examination
   - More frequent imaging if new or worsening symptoms develop

3. **Lifestyle Modifications:**
   - Consider reduced work hours or modified duties to accommodate current neurological symptoms
   - Avoid strenuous physical activity temporarily
   - Ensure adequate rest and stress management

4. **Diabetes Management:**
   - Continue current regimen
   - Monitor glucose levels closely while on dexamethasone
   - Endocrinology follow-up in 2 weeks for diabetes management while on steroids

5. **Hypertension Management:**
   - Increase lisinopril to 20mg daily
   - Home BP monitoring with log

6. **Patient Education:**
   - Seizure precautions reviewed
   - Warning signs that would necessitate immediate medical attention
   - Driving restrictions discussed until seizure-free for at least 3 months

Will closely monitor patient's clinical status and re-evaluate for possible surgical intervention if symptoms worsen, tumor shows significant growth, or conservative management fails.

**KPS Score:** 80 (Normal activity with effort, some signs or symptoms of disease)

**EEG (10/15/2019):** 
Increased epileptiform activity in the left frontoparietal region compared to previous study.

## ASSESSMENT
1. Left convexity meningioma with evidence of growth and increased mass effect
2. Worsening neurological symptoms including breakthrough seizures and progressive right-sided weakness
3. Type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 7.8% (increased likely due to dexamethasone)
4. Hypertension, suboptimally controlled

## PLAN
Given the tumor growth and worsening symptoms, I have had a detailed discussion with the patient about management options. While my recommendation would be to consider surgical resection at this point, the patient has expressed a strong preference to continue non-surgical management if possible.

1. **Symptomatic Management:**
   - Increase dexamethasone to 4mg BID to reduce edema
   - Increase Levetiracetam to 1500mg BID
   - Continue topiramate 50mg BID
   - Add lacosamide 100mg BID as adjunctive seizure therapy

2. **Imaging and Monitoring:**
   - Repeat MRI in 2 months (sooner if new symptoms develop)
   - Neurosurgery follow-up in 2 months
   - Weekly phone check-ins with nurse practitioner

3. **Supportive Care:**
   - Home health evaluation for assistance with ADLs

# NEUROSURGERY FOLLOW-UP NOTE

**Date:** December 20, 2019  
**Patient:** 46-year-old female, blood type A  
**MRN:** 78493215  

## INTERVAL HISTORY
Patient returns earlier than scheduled due to significant clinical deterioration. Family reports patient has had increased confusion over the past week, two generalized seizures despite increased anti-seizure medications, and progressive right-sided weakness now affecting face. Patient has been sleeping more, with decreased oral intake. Morning headaches are severe with occasional vomiting.

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Insulin glargine 15 units nightly (added for steroid-induced hyperglycemia)
- Lisinopril 40mg daily
- Levetiracetam 1500mg BID
- Lacosamide 100mg BID
- Topiramate 50mg BID
- Dexamethasone 4mg BID
- Pantoprazole 40mg daily
- Ondansetron 4mg PRN for nausea

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs:** BP 152/94, HR 88, RR 18, Temp 37.0Â°C, O2 sat 96% on RA

**General:** Patient appears fatigued, in mild distress from headache.

**Neurological:**
- Mental Status: Oriented to person only, confused about time and place
- Cranial Nerves: Left homonymous hemianopsia, new right facial droop (CN VII)
- Motor: Right upper extremity 2/5 strength, right lower extremity 3/5 strength, left side 5/5
- Reflexes: 3+ on right with positive Babinski, 2+ on left
- Coordination: Unable to perform on right side due to weakness
- Gait: Unable to ambulate independently, requires wheelchair

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

**MRI Brain with and without contrast (12/18/2019):** 
Left convexity meningioma now measuring 6.4 cm with significant increase in surrounding edema. Midline shift increased to 12mm with early signs of subfalcine herniation. New area of restricted diffusion in the left posterior frontal lobe consistent with ischemic change due to mass effect.

**Labs:**
- Glucose: 186 mg/dL
- HbA1c: 8.2%
- Sodium: 133 mEq/L (slightly low, likely due to dexamethasone)
- Other electrolytes within normal limits

## ASSESSMENT
1. Left convexity meningioma with significant interval growth, increased mass effect, and early signs of herniation
2. Worsening neurological status with confusion, increased seizure activity, and progressive right-sided weakness
3. Poorly controlled diabetes secondary to steroid therapy
4. Hypertension

## PLAN
Given the significant clinical deterioration and radiographic evidence of increasing mass effect with early herniation, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient and family about the need to reconsider our management approach. The risks of continued conservative management now outweigh the benefits, as the patient is at risk for life-threatening herniation.

After careful consideration, the patient has consented to surgical intervention:

1. **Surgical Plan:**
   - Schedule for left frontoparietal craniotomy for tumor resection within 48 hours
   - Goal is maximal safe resection
   - Tissue will be sent for pathological confirmation of tumor grade
   - Increase dexamethasone to 10mg IV q6h preoperatively

2. **Preoperative Management:**
   - Neurosurgical ICU admission for close monitoring
   - Hypertonic saline 3% at 30mL/hr to help control cerebral edema
   - Continue anti-seizure medications
   - Endocrinology consultation for perioperative diabetes management
   - Preoperative labs, ECG, and chest X-ray

3. **Family Support:**
   - Social work consultation
   - Discussion about potential postoperative rehabilitation needs

The patient and family understand the risks of surgery including bleeding, infection, stroke, seizures, worsening neurological deficits, and death, but also recognize that without intervention, the patient's condition will likely continue to deteriorate with risk of fatal herniation.

**KPS Score:** 40 (Disabled, requires special care and assistance)

Left convexity meningioma, WHO Grade I (pending final pathology)

## PROCEDURE
Left frontoparietal craniotomy for resection of meningioma

## SURGEON
Dr. [Neurosurgeon Name]

## ANESTHESIA
General endotracheal anesthesia

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
450 mL

## COMPLICATIONS
None

## DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE
After obtaining informed consent and marking the patient, she was brought to the operating room and positioned supine with head turned to the right and fixed in Mayfield pins. Standard preoperative antibiotics were administered. A question mark incision was made over the left frontoparietal region. Craniotomy was performed, and dura was opened in a cruciate fashion.

A well-circumscribed, firm, vascular extra-axial mass was identified with attachment to the dura of the left convexity. The tumor was internally debulked using ultrasonic aspirator, followed by careful dissection of the tumor-brain interface. The dural attachment was coagulated and resected. Gross total resection was achieved (Simpson Grade II). Hemostasis was obtained. Dural closure was performed with a dural substitute patch. Bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates and screws. Layered closure of the galea and skin was performed.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Intraoperative frozen section was consistent with meningioma.

## DISPOSITION
Patient was transferred to the Neurosurgical ICU in stable condition, intubated.
