## INITIAL CONSULTATION - June 15, 2014

**PATIENT**: 50-year-old female, blood type B
**OCCUPATION**: Data Scientist
**CHIEF COMPLAINT**: Persistent headaches for 3 months, gradually increasing in intensity; intermittent seizures starting 6 weeks ago; mild left-sided weakness in lower extremity; occasional episodes of confusion and memory lapses; visual disturbances including brief periods of blurred vision

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**:
Patient presents with a 3-month history of progressively worsening headaches, described as constant pressure in the frontal and parietal regions. Six weeks ago, she began experiencing intermittent seizures characterized by jerking movements of the left side of her body. She reports mild left leg weakness that has affected her ability to exercise. Patient also notes occasional episodes of confusion at work and difficulty remembering recent events. Visual disturbances include transient blurred vision lasting several minutes, occurring 2-3 times weekly.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY**:
- History of medical radiation exposure to the head at age 7 for treatment of tinea capitis
- Migraines diagnosed at age 35, previously well-controlled with sumatriptan
- Hysterectomy at age 45 for uterine fibroids
- Mild hypertension managed with lifestyle modifications
- No previous neurological disorders or brain injuries
- Family history negative for brain tumors

**CURRENT MEDICATIONS**:
- Sumatriptan 50mg PRN for migraines
- Levetiracetam 500mg BID (recently prescribed by PCP for seizures)

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION**:
- Vital signs: BP 142/88, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 36.8Â°C
- General: Alert, oriented to person, place, and time
- HEENT: PERRL, fundoscopic exam shows mild papilledema
- Neurological: 
  * CN II-XII intact
  * Motor: 4+/5 strength in left lower extremity, 5/5 elsewhere
  * Sensory: Intact to light touch, pinprick, and vibration
  * Reflexes: 3+ in left lower extremity, 2+ elsewhere
  * Coordination: Mild difficulty with heel-to-shin on left
  * Gait: Slight left-sided limp

**IMAGING STUDIES**:
MRI Brain with and without contrast reveals a 4.2 cm extra-axial, dural-based mass in the parasagittal/falx region with homogeneous enhancement. Mass demonstrates significant mass effect on the adjacent motor cortex with moderate surrounding edema. Radiographic features are consistent with meningioma.

**IMPRESSION**:
4.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma, WHO Grade II (based on radiographic features suggesting atypical characteristics). Given the patient's history of childhood radiation exposure, this likely represents a radiation-induced meningioma, which typically demonstrates more aggressive behavior.

**PLAN**:
1. Recommend urgent surgical resection given:
   - Symptomatic presentation with seizures and focal weakness
   - Evidence of increased intracranial pressure (papilledema)
   - Large size with significant mass effect
   - Radiation-induced meningiomas tend to be more aggressive

2. Pre-surgical management:
   - Increase Levetiracetam to 1000mg BID for seizure control
   - Start Dexamethasone 4mg QID to reduce peritumoral edema
   - Schedule comprehensive pre-operative workup including functional MRI and DTI tractography to map eloquent cortex

3. Patient counseled on the risks and benefits of surgery. Given her occupation as a data scientist and the cognitive symptoms she's experiencing, prompt intervention is particularly important to preserve her intellectual function.

4. Surgery scheduled for June 23, 2014.

**KPS**: 80 (Normal activity with effort, some signs/symptoms of disease)

## OPERATIVE NOTE - June 23, 2014

**PROCEDURE**: Right parasagittal craniotomy for resection of falx/parasagittal meningioma

**SURGEON**: Dr. [Redacted]

**ANESTHESIA**: General endotracheal

**FINDINGS**:
- 4.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma with firm consistency
- Tumor demonstrated significant vascularity
- Invasion of superior sagittal sinus noted
- Simpson Grade II resection achieved (complete macroscopic resection with coagulation of dural attachment)

**DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE**:
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head fixation in Mayfield pins. Neuronavigation was registered. A right parasagittal craniotomy was performed. Upon opening the dura, a firm, well-demarcated tumor was identified. Microsurgical technique was used to carefully dissect the tumor from surrounding brain parenchyma. The tumor was noted to invade the superior sagittal sinus, precluding complete resection of the dural attachment. Meticulous hemostasis was achieved. Dura was closed in watertight fashion. Bone flap was secured, and wound was closed in layers.

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS**: 350 mL

**COMPLICATIONS**: None

**PATHOLOGY REPORT**: Atypical meningioma (WHO Grade II)
- Increased mitotic activity (5 mitoses per 10 HPF)
- Increased cellularity
- Small foci of necrosis
- MIB-1 labeling index: 12%
- Molecular analysis pending

**POST-OPERATIVE PLAN**:
1. ICU monitoring for 24 hours, then transfer to regular floor

**Date:** June 15, 2014
**Patient:** 50-year-old female
**Blood Type:** B
**Occupation:** Data Scientist
**Chief Complaint:** Persistent headaches for 3 months, seizures for 6 weeks, mild left-sided weakness, memory lapses, visual disturbances

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient presents with gradually worsening headaches over the past 3 months, described as dull pressure across the frontal area, worse in the mornings. She reports experiencing 3 episodes of seizures in the past 6 weeks, with brief loss of consciousness and limb jerking. Additional symptoms include mild left-sided weakness in the lower extremity, occasional episodes of confusion and memory lapses, and visual disturbances with brief periods of blurred vision. Patient reports these symptoms have been interfering with her work as a data scientist, particularly the visual disturbances and memory issues.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- History of medical radiation exposure to the head for treatment of tinea capitis at age 7
- Migraines diagnosed at age 35, previously well-controlled with sumatriptan
- Hysterectomy at age 45 for uterine fibroids
- Mild hypertension managed with lifestyle modifications
- No previous neurological disorders or brain injuries
- Family history negative for brain tumors

## MEDICATIONS
- Sumatriptan 50mg PRN for migraines
- No regular antihypertensives

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
- Vital Signs: BP 138/88, HR 76, RR 16, Temp 37.0Â°C
- General: Alert and oriented x3, appears mildly anxious
- HEENT: Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Fundoscopic exam normal.
- Neurological: 
  - CN II-XII intact
  - Motor: 4/5 strength in left lower extremity, 5/5 elsewhere
  - Sensory: Intact to light touch, temperature, and proprioception
  - Reflexes: 2+ throughout, no clonus
  - Coordination: Finger-to-nose intact, mild difficulty with heel-to-shin on left
  - Gait: Mild dragging of left foot

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast (June 12, 2014):**
Reveals a 4.2 cm extra-axial, dural-based mass along the parasagittal/falx region with homogeneous enhancement. Mass demonstrates mild to moderate surrounding edema with mass effect on the adjacent motor cortex. Radiographic features consistent with WHO Grade II meningioma.

## ASSESSMENT
50-year-old female with parasagittal/falx meningioma (4.2 cm) presenting with headaches, seizures, and mild left-sided weakness. Notable history of childhood cranial radiation exposure, which increases risk for development of meningiomas and may predict more aggressive behavior.

## PLAN
Given the patient's history of radiation exposure, occupation requiring cognitive function, and her symptoms, I recommend a conservative approach with close monitoring:

1. **Watchful waiting approach with frequent monitoring:**
   - MRI brain with and without contrast in 3 months to establish growth rate
   - Neuropsychological testing to establish baseline cognitive function

2. **Symptomatic management:**
   - Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure control
   - Dexamethasone 4mg BID for 5 days, then taper to 2mg BID for 5 days, then discontinue to reduce peritumoral edema
   - Continue sumatriptan for breakthrough migraines as needed

3. **Occupational considerations:**
   - Recommend temporary workplace accommodations including reduced screen time, rest breaks
   - Discuss potential for intermittent medical leave if symptoms worsen

4. **Patient education:**
   - Detailed discussion about meningiomas, their natural history, and management options
   - Explanation of increased risk with prior radiation exposure
   - Warning signs requiring immediate medical attention

5. **Follow-up:**
   - Neurosurgery clinic in 3 months with repeat imaging
   - Earlier if symptoms worsen

KPS Score: 80 (Normal activity with effort, some signs of disease)

**MRI Brain with and without contrast (December 13, 2014):**
Parasagittal/falx meningioma now measures 4.6 cm (increased from 4.3 cm). Increased surrounding edema with more significant mass effect on the motor cortex. No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.

## ASSESSMENT
WHO Grade II parasagittal/falx meningioma with evidence of growth and increased mass effect, correlating with worsening neurological symptoms. Patient's quality of life and functional status now significantly affected.

## PLAN
Given the tumor growth and symptom progression, we need to reconsider our management approach:

1. **Treatment options discussed:**
   - Surgical resection: Would address mass effect but carries risks given the location
   - Radiation therapy: Could stabilize growth but may not immediately address mass effect
   - Continued observation: Not recommended given progression
   
2. **Recommendation:**
   - Surgical resection now appears to be the most appropriate option
   - However, patient expresses strong preference to avoid surgery if possible
   - Will respect patient's wishes and offer alternative approach with radiation therapy
   - Referred to radiation oncology for consultation regarding stereotactic radiotherapy

3. **Interim management:**
   - Restart dexamethasone 4mg BID to reduce edema
   - Increase levetiracetam to 750mg BID given risk of seizures with tumor progression
   - Home safety evaluation and potential assistive devices for mobility

4. **Follow-up:**
   - Radiation oncology within 2 weeks
   - Neurosurgery follow-up in 1 month
   - Emphasized importance of seeking immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen acutely

KPS Score: 70 (Cares for self but unable to carry on normal activity or do active work)

Achieved subtotal resection (Simpson Grade IV) with significant residual tumor left in the sinus to preserve venous drainage. Estimated blood loss 800cc. Received 2 units packed red blood cells intraoperatively.

## COMPLICATIONS
Intraoperative venous bleeding from superior sagittal sinus required packing and hemostatic agents.

## PATHOLOGY
Anaplastic meningioma, WHO Grade III
- High mitotic activity (20 mitoses per 10 high-power fields)
- Prominent nucleoli
- Geographic necrosis
- Brain invasion
- MIB-1 proliferation index: 20%
- Genetic analysis: NF2 mutation plus additional TP53 and TERT promoter mutations

## PLAN
1. ICU monitoring for 48 hours
2. Continue dexamethasone
3. Continue levetiracetam

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive headaches over 3 months, right-sided leg weakness, occasional confusion, mild speech hesitation, one seizure-like episode two weeks ago

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient presents with worsening headaches over the past 3 months. Headaches are described as dull, constant, and primarily frontal, increasing in frequency and intensity. She reports gradual development of right lower extremity weakness, occasional episodes of confusion, and difficulty with concentration that has affected her work as a researcher. Patient also notes mild hesitation in speech when attempting to express complex thoughts. Two weeks prior to presentation, family witnessed what appeared to be a seizure-like episode lasting approximately 2 minutes with postictal confusion.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Hypertension controlled with lisinopril
- History of migraines in early adulthood (resolved)
- Surgical menopause at age 48 following hysterectomy for fibroids
- Osteopenia diagnosed 5 years ago
- No prior neurological disorders
- No history of cancer

## FAMILY HISTORY
Mother with breast cancer

## MEDICATIONS
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Calcium 1200mg daily
- Vitamin D 2000 IU daily

## NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION
- Alert and oriented x3
- Cranial nerves II-XII intact
- Motor: 4/5 strength in right lower extremity, 5/5 strength in all other extremities
- Sensory: Intact to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception
- Reflexes: 2+ throughout, negative Babinski
- Coordination: Normal finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin
- Gait: Mild right-sided limp noted

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast:** 3.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma with moderate surrounding edema. Dural tail sign present. No evidence of other intracranial lesions.

**EEG:** Mild slowing over the left frontoparietal region, no epileptiform activity.

## IMPRESSION
62-year-old female researcher with a 3.2 cm left parasagittal/falx meningioma, WHO grade I (presumed). Given the location and symptoms, this is consistent with a meningioma affecting the motor cortex, particularly the leg area.

## PLAN
After thorough discussion with the patient regarding treatment options, we have agreed on a conservative management approach with watchful waiting:

1. Anti-seizure medication: Levetiracetam 500mg BID to prevent further seizures
2. Dexamethasone 4mg BID for 1 week, then taper over 2 weeks to address peritumoral edema
3. Follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess stability
4. Neuropsychological testing to establish baseline cognitive function
5. Referral to neuro-oncology MDT for review and discussion
6. Patient to maintain log of headaches and any new neurological symptoms
7. Discussed potential risks of watchful waiting approach versus surgical intervention
8. Patient understands indications for more aggressive intervention would include: significant tumor growth, worsening neurological symptoms, or intractable seizures

The patient's occupation as a researcher requires significant cognitive function. A conservative approach may allow her to continue her work while we monitor the tumor. We discussed that parasagittal meningiomas can be challenging surgical cases due to potential involvement of the superior sagittal sinus.

Final KPS: 20","I'll create detailed clinical notes for this 61-year-old male meningioma patient, focusing on a conservative management approach over a realistic timeline.

# NEUROSURGICAL CLINICAL NOTE
**Date: March 15, 2014**
**Patient**: 61-year-old male, blood type O
**Occupation**: Librarian
**Reason for Consultation**: Evaluation of incidental meningioma found on CT scan

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient is a 61-year-old right-handed male librarian who sustained a minor fall at work 2 weeks ago. CT scan performed at the emergency department revealed an incidental finding of a small convexity meningioma. Patient reports a 3-month history of persistent headaches, mild right-sided weakness in hand grip, and occasional episodes of confusion while reading. The headaches are described as dull, non-throbbing, and typically worse in the morning.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Hypertension, controlled with lisinopril 10mg daily
- History of migraine headaches in his 30s, resolved spontaneously
- Basal cell carcinoma of nose, surgically removed 5 years ago
- Occasional joint pain managed with as-needed NSAIDs
- No prior neurological disorders
- No family history of brain tumors

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Ibuprofen 400mg PRN for joint pain

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs**: BP 138/82, HR 72, RR 16, Temp 36.8Â°C, O2 sat 98% on RA
**General**: Well-appearing male, alert and oriented x3
**HEENT**: Normocephalic, atraumatic, PERRLA, EOMI
**Neurological**:
- Mental Status: Alert, oriented x3, normal speech, intact memory
- Cranial Nerves: II-XII intact
- Motor: 5/5 strength throughout except for 4+/5 right hand grip
- Sensory: Intact to light touch and pinprick throughout
- Reflexes: 2+ throughout, no pathological reflexes
- Coordination: Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin intact bilaterally
- Gait: Normal, steady

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**CT Head** (performed 2 weeks ago): 0.5 cm extra-axial, dural-based lesion in the left frontal convexity region with characteristics consistent with meningioma. No significant mass effect or surrounding edema.

**MRI Brain with and without contrast** (performed today): Confirms 0.5 cm left frontal convexity extra-axial lesion with homogeneous enhancement, dural tail sign, and no surrounding edema. Features consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma. No other intracranial abnormalities noted.

## ASSESSMENT
61-year-old male with an incidentally discovered small (0.5 cm) left frontal convexity meningioma, likely WHO Grade I. Patient's headaches and mild right hand weakness may not be directly related to this small lesion given its size and location, but warrant monitoring. The episodes of confusion while reading could be multifactorial including possible early cognitive changes, work-related stress, or potentially related to the meningioma.

## PLAN
1. Conservative management with watchful waiting approach is recommended given the small size, lack of significant symptoms clearly attributable to the lesion, and typical benign characteristics.
2. Follow-up MRI in 6 months to assess for any growth.
3. Headache management:
   - Trial of acetaminophen 500mg TID for headache control
   - Avoid NSAIDs for headache due to potential interaction with hypertension management
4. Recommend occupational therapy evaluation for strategies to optimize hand function during work tasks.
5. Discussed potential signs of neurological deterioration to watch for and report.
6. Patient educated about meningiomas, their typically slow growth, and rationale for observation rather than immediate intervention.
7. Return to clinic in 6 months with repeat MRI or sooner if symptoms worsen.

- CT head: Confirms presence of mass with no significant calcification. No hyperostosis of the skull base.

**IMPRESSION**:
3.1 cm olfactory groove meningioma, WHO grade pending pathology. Given the patient's history of radiation exposure at age 25, this represents a likely radiation-induced meningioma, which carries a higher risk of aggressive behavior and recurrence.

**PLAN**:
1. Recommend surgical resection via bifrontal craniotomy approach with the goal of gross total resection
2. Pre-operative optimization:
   - Dexamethasone 4mg PO QID to reduce peritumoral edema
   - Levetiracetam 500mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis
3. Schedule surgery within 2 weeks
4. Detailed discussion with patient regarding risks/benefits of surgery including potential for anosmia, CSF leak, infection, bleeding, and frontal lobe injury
5. Genetic testing to rule out NF2 and other genetic syndromes given history of radiation exposure
6. Patient educated on the importance of early intervention given:
   - Progressive symptomatology affecting quality of life and occupation
   - History of radiation exposure increasing risk of aggressive behavior
   - Size and location of tumor with ongoing mass effect

**KPS**: 80 (Normal activity with effort, some symptoms of disease)

**Date:** June 15, 2019  
**Patient:** 40-year-old female, blood type A  
**Occupation:** Software Developer  
**MRN:** 1247893

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive loss of smell (anosmia), persistent frontal headaches, personality changes including irritability, difficulty concentrating while coding, occasional visual disturbances, mild nausea in the mornings, and recent onset of left-sided facial numbness.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient is a 40-year-old female software developer who presents for evaluation of progressive neurological symptoms. She reports gradual loss of smell over the past 8 months, accompanied by persistent frontal headaches that are different from her usual migraines. Patient describes increasing difficulty concentrating during work, which involves long hours of coding. Family members have noted personality changes with increased irritability. She also reports occasional visual disturbances described as ""brief blurring"" and morning nausea. Left-sided facial numbness began approximately 2 weeks ago.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- History of radiation therapy to head and neck region for benign thyroid nodule at age 25
- Migraine headaches since adolescence
- Depression treated with SSRIs for 5 years
- Surgical removal of ovarian cyst 8 years ago
- Family history of breast cancer (maternal aunt)
- No known drug allergies
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Escitalopram 10mg daily
- Sumatriptan as needed for migraines
- Multivitamin daily

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs:** BP 124/78, HR 72, RR 16, Temp 36.8Â°C, O2 Sat 99% RA

**Neurological Examination:**
- Alert and oriented x3
- Cranial nerves: CN I diminished bilaterally (unable to identify common odors), CN V with decreased sensation in V2 distribution on left side, remaining cranial nerves intact
- Motor: 5/5 strength throughout
- Sensory: Intact to light touch except for left facial numbness
- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric
- Coordination: Normal finger-to-nose testing
- Gait: Normal, no ataxia
- Fundoscopic exam: No papilledema

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast:** 3.2 cm extra-axial mass arising from the olfactory groove with homogeneous enhancement. Mass demonstrates dural tail sign, with mild peritumoral edema. Features consistent with olfactory groove meningioma. No hydrocephalus.

**CT Head:** Confirms presence of mass with minimal hyperostosis of adjacent bone.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
40-year-old female with radiographic evidence of an olfactory groove meningioma (3.2 cm) with symptoms consistent with tumor location. Given her history of prior radiation exposure at a young age, this may represent a radiation-induced meningioma, which carries higher risk for aggressive behavior.

After thorough discussion with the patient regarding treatment options including surgical resection versus watchful waiting, we have decided on a conservative management approach with careful monitoring at this time:

1. Surveillance MRI in 3 months to establish growth rate
2. Referral to neuro-ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing
3. Dexamethasone 4mg twice daily for 7 days to address peritumoral edema, then taper
4. Acetaminophen 500mg as needed for headache
5. Continue current medications
6. Patient education regarding symptoms that would warrant urgent evaluation (severe headache, visual changes, seizures, altered mental status)
7. Consider surgical intervention if:
   - Significant tumor growth on surveillance imaging
   - Progressive neurological deficits
   - Intractable symptoms

Patient understands the rationale for conservative management and agrees with plan. She has been counseled on the WHO grade I presumptive classification (pending definitive histology) and potential long-term implications.

# NEUROSURGICAL CLINICAL NOTE - FOLLOW-UP VISIT

**Date:** June 25, 2020  
**Patient:** 41-year-old female, blood type A  
**Occupation:** Software Developer (working remotely)  
**MRN:** 1247893

## INTERVAL HISTORY
Patient returns for 3-month follow-up. Reports experiencing a first-time seizure 2 weeks ago, described as brief loss of awareness followed by confusion lasting approximately 10 minutes. Witnessed by spouse who reports no convulsive activity. Headaches have increased in frequency and intensity despite medication. Visual symptoms now occurring 2-3 times weekly. Reports significant impact on work performance and quality of life.

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS

**Vital Signs:** BP 138/86, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 36.7Â°C

**Neurological Examination:**
- Alert and oriented x3
- Cranial nerves: CN I absent bilaterally, CN V with decreased sensation in V2 distribution on left side, subtle right CN VI palsy with mild limitation of abduction
- Motor: 5/5 strength throughout
- Sensory: Intact to light touch except for left facial numbness
- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric
- Coordination: Normal
- Gait: Stable
- Fundoscopic exam: Early papilledema noted

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast:** Olfactory groove meningioma now measures 3.9 cm with significant increase in peritumoral edema extending to the frontal lobe. Early signs of mass effect on the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle.

**EEG:** Focal slowing over the right frontal region. No epileptiform activity captured during recording.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
41-year-old female with progressively growing olfactory groove meningioma, now with seizure activity, increasing headaches, and early signs of increased intracranial pressure. Given these concerning developments, we have had an extensive discussion about management options. While the patient has previously preferred conservative management, the clinical and radiographic progression now warrants more definitive intervention.

After thorough discussion of risks and benefits, we have decided to proceed with:

1. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (rather than surgical resection) given:
   - Patient's strong preference to avoid open surgery
   - Tumor location amenable to radiation
   - History of radiation-induced meningioma raising concerns about potential aggressive behavior
   
2. Continue Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis
3. Increase dexamethasone to 4mg TID for 2 weeks, then slow taper
4. Referral to radiation oncology (appointment scheduled for next week)
5. Follow-up MRI 3 months after completion of radiation therapy

The patient understands that radiotherapy aims to halt tumor growth rather than remove the tumor, and that symptoms may persist or only gradually improve. She also understands the potential long-term risks of radiation therapy, particularly given her history of prior radiation exposure, but accepts these risks given her current symptom progression.

**WHO Grade:** Presumed Grade I meningioma (radiographic appearance)
**KPS Score:** 70 (Cares for self but unable to carry on normal activity or do active work)

**Occupation:** Software Developer  
**MRN:** 1247893

## INTERVAL HISTORY
Patient returns for 3-month follow-up. Reports two additional episodes of transient right-sided weakness and speech difficulties, each lasting 10-15 minutes with spontaneous resolution. Neurology evaluation suggested these represent focal seizures rather than TIAs. Headaches have increased in frequency over past month. No changes in anosmia or facial numbness.

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Escitalopram 10mg daily
- Sumatriptan as needed for migraines
- Acetaminophen 1000mg PRN for headache
- Levetiracetam 1000mg BID (increased by neurologist)

- Gait: Stable

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast:** Olfactory groove meningioma stable at 3.7 cm. Previously noted 4mm enhancing focus has increased to 7mm with surrounding edema. Features concerning for higher-grade component or radiation-induced changes.

**Carotid Ultrasound:** No significant stenosis.

**EEG:** Focal epileptiform discharges in the right frontal region.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
43-year-old female with history of radiation-induced olfactory groove meningioma now with enlarging satellite lesion and breakthrough seizures despite increased antiepileptic medication. Given the concerning growth of the satellite lesion and its radiographic features, there is concern for possible progression to a higher-grade component.

After extensive discussion with the patient regarding options:

1. Recommend surgical biopsy of the enlarging satellite lesion to determine histology and grade
2. Continue increased Levetiracetam dosage
3. Add Lacosamide 100mg BID for enhanced seizure control
4. MRI to be repeated after biopsy results to guide further management
5. Discussed potential need for more aggressive intervention depending on biopsy results

The patient understands the concern for possible higher-grade transformation and agrees to surgical biopsy. We discussed that radiation-induced meningiomas have higher rates of atypical and malignant features, which could explain the breakthrough seizures and satellite lesion growth.

# NEUROSURGICAL CLINICAL NOTE

**Date**: March 15, 2014
**Patient**: John Doe
**Age**: 48
**Sex**: Male
**Blood Type**: B
**Referral**: Primary care physician for evaluation of persistent headaches and visual changes

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Persistent right-sided headaches for 4 months, progressive visual field deficits in the right eye, occasional diplopia, mild right-sided facial numbness, and recent onset of memory difficulties

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient is a 48-year-old right-handed male who works as a commercial airline pilot. He presents with a 4-month history of persistent right-sided headaches that have become increasingly frequent and intense. He describes the headaches as ""different from my usual migraines."" The pain is predominantly located in the right temporal region and is not fully relieved by his usual migraine medication. He reports progressive visual field deficits in the right eye over the past 2 months, with occasional diplopia when looking to the extreme right. He has also noticed mild numbness on the right side of his face and has experienced difficulty with short-term memory, particularly remembering flight schedules and protocols, which is concerning given his profession.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 8 years ago, managed with metformin and lifestyle modifications
- Hypertension for 5 years, controlled with lisinopril
- History of migraine headaches since early adulthood, previously managed with sumatriptan
- Appendectomy at age 22
- Family history of cardiovascular disease

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Sumatriptan 50mg PRN for migraines
- Acetaminophen 500mg PRN for headaches

## SOCIAL HISTORY
Patient is an active commercial airline pilot with strict health requirements for maintaining his license. He is married with two teenage children. He reports moderate alcohol consumption (2-3 drinks weekly) and denies tobacco use. Exercise includes walking 3 times weekly.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs**: BP 138/84, HR 72, RR 16, Temp 36.8Â°C, O2 Sat 98% on room air

**General**: Alert, oriented x3, in no acute distress

**HEENT**: Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Right eye shows subtle temporal visual field deficit on confrontation testing. Extraocular movements intact with minimal diplopia on extreme right lateral gaze.

**Neurological Examination**:
- **Cranial Nerves**: CN V shows decreased sensation in V2 distribution on right side. Other cranial nerves intact.
- **Motor**: 5/5 strength throughout all extremities
- **Sensory**: Intact to light touch, pin prick, and proprioception except for right facial numbness
- **Reflexes**: 2+ and symmetric throughout
- **Coordination**: Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing normal
- **Gait**: Normal, tandem gait intact

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

**MRI Brain with and without contrast (03/10/2014)**: 
3.1 cm extra-axial, dural-based mass arising from the right sphenoid wing with homogeneous enhancement. The lesion demonstrates mild to moderate mass effect on the adjacent right temporal lobe with minimal surrounding vasogenic edema. Radiographic characteristics consistent with a sphenoid wing meningioma.

**Visual Field Testing**: 
Right temporal hemianopsia consistent with compression of the right optic tract.

## ASSESSMENT
48-year-old male with a 3.1 cm right sphenoid wing meningioma (WHO grade I presumed, pending histological confirmation if surgery pursued). The tumor is causing progressive neurological symptoms including right-sided headaches, visual field deficits, occasional diplopia, facial numbness, and cognitive changes. Given the patient's occupation as a pilot, these symptoms significantly impact his quality of life and ability to work.

## PLAN
1. Discussed management options including surgical resection, radiation therapy, and watchful waiting with the patient.

2. Given the patient's preference for non-surgical approaches and concern about potential complications affecting his pilot license, we will proceed with a conservative management approach with close monitoring.

3. **Watchful waiting approach**:
   - Follow-up MRI in 3 months to establish growth rate
   - Comprehensive neuro-ophthalmological evaluation
   - Formal neuropsychological testing to establish baseline cognitive function

4. **Symptom management**:
   - Dexamethasone 4mg daily to reduce peritumoral edema and potentially improve symptoms
   - Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis given the location of the tumor
   - Discontinue sumatriptan due to potential vascular effects

5. **Patient education**:
   - Discussed potential need to temporarily discontinue work as pilot pending symptom control and FAA medical requirements
   - Provided information about meningiomas, typical growth patterns, and warning signs requiring immediate attention

6. Return to clinic in 1 month to assess symptom response to medical management.

7. **Patient has been informed of the following**:
   - While many meningiomas grow slowly or remain stable, close monitoring is essential
   - If symptoms worsen or tumor growth is demonstrated, surgical intervention may become necessary
   - Temporary grounding from pilot duties may be required regardless of treatment approach

**Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)**: 90 - Able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease.

# OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date: 03/18/2014**

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Intraventricular meningioma with obstructive hydrocephalus

**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Intraventricular meningioma, WHO Grade I

**PROCEDURE**: Right frontal craniotomy with transcortical approach for resection of intraventricular meningioma

**SURGEON**: Dr. James Wilson

**ANESTHESIA**: General endotracheal

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS**: 350 cc

**COMPLICATIONS**: None

**OPERATIVE FINDINGS**:
Well-circumscribed, highly vascular 3.8 cm intraventricular mass attached to the choroid plexus. Gross total resection achieved.

**OPERATIVE DESCRIPTION**:
After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. The patient was positioned supine with the head in a Mayfield pin fixation device, turned 30 degrees to the left. A right frontal craniotomy was performed. A transcortical approach through the middle frontal gyrus was utilized to access the lateral ventricle. Upon entering the ventricle, a well-circumscribed, highly vascular mass was identified attached to the choroid plexus. Careful microdissection was performed to separate the tumor from surrounding neural structures. The tumor was internally debulked and then dissected circumferentially. Complete resection was achieved (Simpson Grade I). Meticulous hemostasis was obtained. The dura was closed in a watertight fashion, the bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates, and the scalp was closed in layers. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

**PATHOLOGY**: Specimen sent for frozen and permanent section. Preliminary results consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma.

# OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date: 08/24/2017**

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Recurrent intraventricular meningioma with hydrocephalus

**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Recurrent intraventricular meningioma, WHO Grade II (pending final pathology)

**PROCEDURE**: Right frontal re-craniotomy for resection of recurrent intraventricular meningioma with placement of external ventricular drain

**SURGEON**: Dr. James Wilson

**ANESTHESIA**: General endotracheal

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS**: 600 cc

**COMPLICATIONS**: None

**OPERATIVE FINDINGS**:
Recurrent, more aggressive-appearing tumor at the site of previous resection with extension into the ventricular system. Tumor appeared more vascular and infiltrative than during the first operation. Near-total resection achieved with small residual attached to deep venous structures.

**OPERATIVE DESCRIPTION**:
After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. The previous right frontal craniotomy site was reopened. Significant scarring was encountered from the previous surgery. The transcortical approach was utilized to access the lateral ventricle. Upon entering the ventricle, a large, vascular mass was identified with extension into the ventricular system. The tumor appeared more aggressive and infiltrative compared to the initial surgery. Careful microdissection was performed, but complete resection was limited by tumor adherence to deep venous structures. A near-total resection was achieved with a small residual left intentionally to avoid vascular injury. An external ventricular drain was placed. Hemostasis was obtained. The dura was closed, the bone flap replaced, and the scalp closed in layers. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

**PATHOLOGY**: Specimen sent for frozen and permanent section. Preliminary results suggest progression to WHO Grade II meningioma.

# PATHOLOGY REPORT
**Date: 08/28/2017**

**SPECIMEN**: Recurrent intraventricular tumor

**GROSS DESCRIPTION**:
The specimen consists of multiple fragments of tan-gray tissue measuring 2.4 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm in aggregate.

**MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION**:
Sections show a meningothelial neoplasm with increased cellularity compared to the previous specimen. There are areas of sheet-like growth and focal loss of whorling pattern. Mitotic figures are increased (4-6 per 10 high-power fields). Small foci of necrosis are present. Brain invasion is not identified. Ki-67 proliferation index is approximately 12%.

**IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY**:
- EMA: Positive
- Progesterone receptor: Positive but reduced compared to previous specimen
- Ki-67: 12% labeling index (increased from 2% in previous specimen)
- SSTR2: Positive

**MOLECULAR STUDIES**:
- NF2 mutation: Detected
- TERT promoter mutation: Negative
- Chromosomal analysis: Loss of chromosome 1p

**DIAGNOSIS**:
Atypical meningioma, WHO Grade II

**COMMENT**:
The current specimen shows histological progression compared to the previous resection (2014), which was diagnosed as WHO Grade I meningioma. The increased mitotic activity, focal necrosis, and higher Ki-67 index are consistent with progression to WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma. The newly detected NF2 mutation and loss of chromosome 1p suggest genetic progression.

3. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
4. Hypertension
5. Obesity
6. Obstructive sleep apnea
7. Hyperlipidemia
8. Diabetic nephropathy

**HOSPITAL COURSE**:
The patient underwent right frontal re-craniotomy for resection of recurrent intraventricular meningioma on 08/24/2017. Near-total resection was achieved with small residual tumor left attached to deep venous structures. An external ventricular drain was placed intraoperatively. Pathology revealed progression to WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma.

Post-operatively, the patient was monitored in the neurosurgical ICU. The EVD was successfully weaned but the patient developed recurrent hydrocephalus requiring conversion to a ventriculoperitoneal shunt on 08/30/2017. The patient experienced transient worsening of diabetes control requiring insulin therapy. MRI on 08/28/2017 confirmed near-total resection with small residual tumor.

Given the progression to WHO Grade II meningioma and subtotal resection, adjuvant radiation therapy was recommended. Neurosurgery and radiation oncology had a multidisciplinary discussion, and the decision was made to proceed with fractionated radiation therapy after a period of recovery from surgery.

**DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS**:
1. Dexamethasone 2mg PO BID with taper over 2 weeks
2. Levetiracetam 750mg PO BID
3. Metformin 1000mg PO BID

## INITIAL CONSULTATION - 03/15/2019

**PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS:**
- 59-year-old female
- Blood type: O
- Occupation: Data Scientist/Chef

**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**
Progressive right-sided headaches for 3 months, worsening over past 2 weeks, with recent onset of blurry vision in right eye.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**
Patient presents with 3-month history of progressive right-sided headaches that have intensified over the past 2 weeks. She reports recent blurry vision in the right eye, occasional nausea without vomiting, and mild right-sided facial numbness. Patient notes significant difficulty concentrating at work, especially when looking at computer screens for extended periods. Headache pattern is distinctly different from her long-standing migraines.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:**
- Hypertension (7 years), well-controlled on lisinopril 10mg daily
- Migraine headaches since age 30, previously managed with sumatriptan PRN
- Cholecystectomy at age 45
- No prior neurological disorders or brain injuries
- No family history of brain tumors
- No known drug allergies

**CURRENT MEDICATIONS:**
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Sumatriptan as needed
- Occasional NSAIDs for tension headaches

**NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:**
- Alert and oriented x3
- Cranial nerves: Right-sided facial hypesthesia in V2 distribution
- Visual acuity: Right eye 20/40, Left eye 20/20
- Visual fields: Right superior temporal quadrantanopia
- Motor: 5/5 strength throughout
- Sensory: Intact to light touch, temperature, and proprioception
- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric
- Coordination: Normal finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin
- Gait: Normal, no ataxia

**DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:**
MRI brain with and without contrast reveals a 4.2 cm extra-axial mass arising from the right sphenoid wing with significant mass effect on the adjacent temporal lobe. Enhancement pattern and dural tail are consistent with meningioma. Moderate surrounding vasogenic edema is noted.

**IMPRESSION:**
Right sphenoid wing meningioma, WHO Grade II (based on imaging characteristics suggesting atypical features including irregular borders and significant edema).

**TREATMENT PLAN:**
1. Recommend prompt surgical resection given the size, location, and symptomatic nature of the tumor
2. Schedule for craniotomy and tumor resection within 2 weeks
3. Start dexamethasone 4mg BID to reduce peritumoral edema
4. Obtain additional imaging: CT head with bone windows to evaluate bone involvement, MR angiography to assess vascular supply
5. Comprehensive neuropsychological testing pre-operatively
6. Discuss potential need for adjuvant radiation therapy post-resection depending on pathology and extent of resection
7. Occupational considerations: Patient will require 6-8 weeks off work post-surgery

**DISCUSSION:**
I have thoroughly discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives with the patient. Given her symptomatic presentation, occupation requiring visual focus and cognitive function, and the concerning size and location of the tumor, I strongly recommend early surgical intervention.

59-year-old female with a 2.2cm right sphenoid wing meningioma (WHO Grade I) causing progressive headaches, right visual disturbance, and mild right-sided facial numbness. Symptoms are impacting her ability to work effectively as both a data scientist and chef.

## PLAN
After thorough discussion of treatment options including surgical resection, radiotherapy, and observation with the patient, we have decided to pursue a conservative management approach with close monitoring:

1. **Watchful waiting with serial imaging:**
   - MRI brain with and without contrast in 3 months to establish growth rate
   - If stable, subsequent MRIs at 6-month intervals for the first year

2. **Symptomatic management:**
   - Dexamethasone 4mg daily for 7 days with taper to reduce peritumoral edema
   - Acetazolamide 250mg twice daily to reduce intracranial pressure
   - Discontinue sumatriptan due to potential vasoconstrictive effects
   - Switch to topiramate 25mg daily, titrating to 50mg twice daily for headache prophylaxis

3. **Lifestyle modifications:**
   - Ergonomic assessment of computer workstation
   - Regular breaks from screen time (20 minutes of work followed by 5-minute break)
   - Avoiding excessive heat exposure while cooking
   - Hydration regimen of at least 2L of water daily

4. **Follow-up:**
   - Neurosurgery clinic in 4 weeks
   - Neuro-ophthalmology referral for baseline assessment and monitoring of visual symptoms

## PLAN
1. **Treatment recommendation:**
   - Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT): 25 Gy in 5 fractions
   - Treatment planned with 1-2mm margin around tumor
   - Special attention to limit dose to right optic nerve and chiasm

2. **Pre-treatment preparation:**
   - Simulation CT and MRI fusion scheduled for June 10, 2015
   - Treatment to begin approximately June 17, 2015

3. **Medications during treatment:**
   - Dexamethasone 1mg daily during treatment and for 2 weeks after
   - Continue current medications

4. **Follow-up:**
   - Weekly during treatment
   - 1 month after completion of treatment
   - MRI brain with and without contrast 3 months after completion

Patient understands the risks, benefits, and alternatives to SRT and wishes to proceed with treatment as recommended.

Patient also developed diabetes insipidus requiring DDAVP for 48 hours, which subsequently resolved. Postoperative MRI showed successful debulking with approximately 60% of tumor removed. Final pathology confirmed WHO Grade II atypical meningioma with increased mitotic index (7 mitoses per 10 high-power fields) and areas of necrosis. Patient gradually improved with rehabilitation therapy and is now stable for discharge.

# RADIATION ONCOLOGY CONSULTATION
**Date:** 06/16/2016
**Patient:** Jane Doe
**Age:** 58
**Gender:** Female

## REASON FOR CONSULTATION
Evaluation for adjuvant radiation therapy following subtotal resection of WHO Grade II atypical meningioma.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
58-year-old female with right sphenoid wing meningioma initially treated with fractionated radiotherapy in 12/2014. Tumor showed progression in 04/2016 and patient underwent subtotal resection on 05/18/2016 with pathology showing WHO Grade II atypical meningioma.

## ASSESSMENT
Given the WHO Grade II histology and subtotal resection, adjuvant radiation therapy is recommended. However, this is complicated by the patient's prior course of radiation to the same region approximately 18 months ago. Options include:

1. Observation with close monitoring given recent prior radiation
2. Targeted re-irradiation to residual tumor with reduced dose
3. Consideration of alternative treatments such as radiosurgery to residual tumor

## PLAN
1. Recommend observation at this time given recent prior radiation and surgical debulking
2. Will review upcoming MRI to assess residual disease
3. If progression is noted, will consider focal re-irradiation with modified fractionation
4. Follow-up in 6 weeks after MRI
5. KPS: 60

# NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL NOTE
**Date:** 05/15/2014
**Patient:** Female, 47 years old
**Blood Type:** O+
**Reason for Visit:** Initial consultation for evaluation of neurological symptoms

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient presents with persistent headaches increasing in frequency and severity over the past 3 months. Headaches are described as throbbing, primarily in the left frontal region, and not fully responsive to OTC analgesics. Patient also reports two episodes of seizures in the past month, characterized by right-sided twitching and loss of consciousness. She has experienced progressive weakness in her right leg, mild confusion, personality changes (described by husband as ""more irritable and withdrawn""), and increasing difficulty with concentration and memory tasks at her job as a university professor.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Hypertension controlled with lisinopril 10mg daily
- Migraine headaches since age 30
- Surgical removal of ovarian cyst 10 years ago
- No prior neurological disorders
- No history of radiation exposure
- Family history of breast cancer (mother diagnosed at age 52)

## MEDICATIONS
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Oral contraceptives (Ortho Tri-Cyclen) for 15 years
- Sumatriptan as needed for migraines

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
- Vital Signs: BP 138/85, HR 76, RR 16, Temp 36.7Â°C

  - Sensory: Intact to light touch and pinprick
  - Reflexes: 3+ in right lower extremity, 2+ elsewhere
  - Gait: Mild right-sided limp
  - Cognitive: MMSE score 26/30 with deficits in attention and recall

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast (05/12/2014):**
4.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma in the left frontal region with significant adjacent vasogenic edema. Mass effect on the motor cortex with mild midline shift of 4mm. Homogeneous enhancement with dural tail sign. No evidence of invasion of the superior sagittal sinus.

## IMPRESSION
47-year-old female with a large left parasagittal/falx meningioma (WHO Grade I presumed) causing progressive neurological symptoms including headaches, seizures, right leg weakness, and cognitive changes. The size, location, and symptomatic nature of this lesion warrant prompt surgical intervention.

## TREATMENT PLAN
1. **Recommend early surgical intervention:** Schedule for craniotomy and gross total resection within 2 weeks given the progressive neurological deficits and size of lesion.
2. **Preoperative management:**
   - Start Dexamethasone 4mg QID to reduce peritumoral edema
   - Start Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis
   - Discontinue oral contraceptives immediately (may contribute to meningioma growth)
3. **Comprehensive imaging protocol:** 
   - Order MR venography to better evaluate superior sagittal sinus involvement
   - Functional MRI to map motor cortex given proximity to motor strip
   - CT angiogram to evaluate vascular supply
4. **Post-surgical plan:**
   - Early post-operative MRI (within 48 hours)
   - Aggressive rehabilitation program for right leg weakness
   - Close interval follow-up with serial imaging
5. **Patient education:** Discussed occupational implications; recommended medical leave from teaching duties for minimum 6-8 weeks post-surgery.

Patient understands the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgical intervention and wishes to proceed with surgery as recommended. Surgery scheduled for 05/28/2014.

**KPS Score:** 80 (Normal activity with effort, some signs of disease)

# NEUROSURGERY OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date:** 05/28/2014
**Patient:** Female, 47 years old
**Procedure:** Left frontal craniotomy for resection of parasagittal/falx meningioma

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left parasagittal/falx meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left parasagittal/falx meningioma (pending pathology)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head fixed in Mayfield pins. Neuronavigation was registered. A left frontal horseshoe incision was made. Craniotomy was performed exposing the superior sagittal sinus and surrounding dura. Upon opening the dura, a well-circumscribed, firm, extra-axial mass was identified attached to the falx cerebri. The tumor was internally debulked and then dissected from the surrounding brain parenchyma. Careful microdissection was performed to separate the tumor from the motor cortex. The falx attachment was coagulated and cut. Gross total resection was achieved with preservation of all major vessels and venous structures. Intraoperative neuromonitoring showed stable motor evoked potentials throughout the procedure. Hemostasis was achieved, dura was closed in a watertight fashion, bone flap replaced, and scalp closed in layers.

Estimated blood loss: 300cc
Complications: None

## PLAN
- Continue dexamethasone with taper
- Continue levetiracetam
- Early mobilization
- MRI brain within 48 hours
- Pathology review at upcoming neuro-oncology MDT

# OPERATIVE NOTE

**Date: June 5, 2015**
**Procedure**: Repeat left parasagittal craniotomy for resection of recurrent meningioma
**Surgeon**: Dr. [Name]

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent WHO Grade II (Atypical) Left Parasagittal/Falx Meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent WHO Grade II (Atypical) Left Parasagittal/Falx Meningioma with possible malignant transformation (pending final pathology)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
Previous left parasagittal craniotomy was reopened and extended.

**CHIEF COMPLAINT**: Progressive anosmia (8 months), worsening frontal headaches (3 months), personality changes, episodes of confusion, and recent visual disturbances

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**:
Patient presents with 8-month history of progressive loss of sense of smell, accompanied by increasingly severe frontal headaches over the past 3 months. Family members report personality changes including irritability and apathy. Patient has experienced occasional episodes of confusion and recent onset of blurred vision. These symptoms have been affecting her ability to work as a baker, particularly due to the loss of smell which is critical in her profession.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY**:
- Hypertension (12 years) - managed with lisinopril
- Class II obesity (BMI 37) - multiple failed weight management attempts
- Sleep apnea (5 years) - uses CPAP nightly
- Cholecystectomy at age 54
- Osteoarthritis in both knees
- History of migraines in early adulthood (resolved until recent pattern)
- No prior neurological disorders or brain injuries
- Family history: Mother with breast cancer

**CURRENT MEDICATIONS**:
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Acetaminophen PRN for knee pain
- Multivitamin daily

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION**:
- Vital signs: BP 142/88, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 98.6Â°F
- Neurological: Alert and oriented x3, but with mild slowness in responses
- Cranial nerves: CN I diminished bilaterally (anosmia), remaining cranial nerves intact
- Motor: 5/5 strength throughout
- Sensory: Intact to light touch and pinprick
- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric
- Gait: Normal, no ataxia
- Fundoscopic exam: Mild papilledema noted bilaterally

**DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES**:
MRI Brain with and without contrast reveals a 4.1 cm extra-axial mass in the olfactory groove region with significant mass effect on bilateral frontal lobes. Enhancement pattern and dural tail sign consistent with meningioma. Moderate surrounding edema noted.

**IMPRESSION**:
66-year-old female with a 4.1 cm olfactory groove meningioma, likely WHO Grade I, causing progressive neurological symptoms including anosmia, headaches, personality changes, and early signs of increased intracranial pressure.

**TREATMENT PLAN**:
1. Recommend urgent surgical resection via bifrontal craniotomy approach to achieve gross total resection
2. Pre-operative optimization with:
   - Dexamethasone 4mg q6h to reduce perilesional edema
   - Optimization of blood pressure control
   - Pre-operative labs and medical clearance
3. Schedule surgery within 2 weeks given progressive symptoms and occupation-related impact
4. Post-operative MRI within 48 hours to assess extent of resection
5. Genetic testing to rule out hereditary syndromes associated with meningiomas

**DISCUSSION WITH PATIENT**:
Discussed the natural history of meningiomas, surgical approach, risks/benefits, and alternative treatment options. Emphasized that early intervention is strongly recommended given the size, location, and progressive symptoms. Explained that her occupation as a baker is significantly impacted by anosmia, which is unlikely to improve without tumor removal. Discussed how her obesity and sleep apnea may complicate perioperative management but are not contraindications to surgery.

**KPS SCORE**: 80 (Normal activity with effort, some signs/symptoms of disease)

Follow-up: Post-surgical follow-up in 2 weeks.

## OPERATIVE NOTE - 03/28/2014

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Left frontal convexity meningioma

**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Left frontal convexity meningioma, presumed WHO Grade I

**PROCEDURE PERFORMED:** Left frontal craniotomy for resection of convexity meningioma

**SURGEON:** Dr. Alexandra Reynolds

**ANESTHESIA:** General endotracheal

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:** 250 cc

**COMPLICATIONS:** None

**DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:**
After obtaining informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. The patient was positioned supine with the head fixed in a Mayfield three-pin head holder with the head turned 30 degrees to the right. The left frontal region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A curvilinear incision was made in the left frontal region. Hemostasis was achieved with bipolar electrocautery and hemoclips. A left frontal craniotomy was performed. The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion.

The tumor was immediately visible as a firm, well-circumscribed, extra-axial mass with typical meningioma appearance. Using microsurgical technique, the tumor was carefully dissected from the surrounding brain parenchyma. The tumor was noted to have a broad dural attachment which was coagulated and resected. The tumor was removed en bloc. The involved dura and overlying hyperostotic bone were resected. Hemostasis was achieved.

The dura was closed in a watertight fashion. The bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates and screws. The galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

**PATHOLOGY:** Specimens sent for frozen and permanent sections. Preliminary pathology suggests WHO Grade I meningioma.

## OPERATIVE NOTE - 03/12/2019

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Recurrent left frontal meningioma status post SRS

**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Recurrent left frontal meningioma with atypical features

**PROCEDURE PERFORMED:** Left frontal re-craniotomy for resection of recurrent meningioma

**SURGEON:** Dr. Alexandra Reynolds

**ANESTHESIA:** General endotracheal

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:** 350 cc

**COMPLICATIONS:** None

**DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:**
After obtaining informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. The patient was positioned supine with the head fixed in a Mayfield three-pin head holder with the head turned 30 degrees to the right. The previous left frontal incision was marked and the area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

The previous incision was reopened and the previous craniotomy site was exposed. The previous bone flap was removed. The dura was noted to be thickened and adherent to the underlying brain. The dura was opened carefully. The tumor was identified as a firm, moderately vascular mass with areas of apparent invasion into the surrounding brain parenchyma, which differed from the initial surgery. The tumor was carefully dissected from surrounding structures using microsurgical technique.

The tumor and involved dura were resected along with a margin of apparently normal dura. The adjacent small dural nodule identified on preoperative MRI was also resected. Frozen section suggested atypical features. Hemostasis was achieved.

The dura was closed with a duraplasty using a pericranial graft. The bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates and screws. The galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

**PATHOLOGY:** Specimens sent for frozen and permanent sections.

## OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date:** March 25, 2014
**Procedure:** Right frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of sphenoid wing meningioma

### PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma

### POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma, WHO Grade I (preliminary pathology)

### PROCEDURE DETAILS
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with the head rotated 30 degrees to the left. A right frontotemporal craniotomy was performed. The dura was opened and the sylvian fissure was widely split. The tumor was identified as a firm, well-demarcated mass arising from the right sphenoid wing with extension into the orbit. Internal debulking was performed followed by careful dissection of the tumor from surrounding neurovascular structures. Hyperostotic bone was drilled away. The tumor was removed in a piecemeal fashion with attention to preserving the optic nerve and carotid artery. Simpson Grade II resection was achieved with coagulation of the dural attachment. Hemostasis was obtained, and the dura was closed in a watertight fashion. The bone flap was secured, and the wound was closed in layers.

### ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
350 mL

## OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date:** August 3, 2020
**Procedure:** Third right frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of recurrent sphenoid wing tumor

### PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent right sphenoid wing tumor

### POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent meningioma, WHO Grade III (anaplastic) per intraoperative frozen section

### PROCEDURE DETAILS
Previous incision was reopened. Significant scarring was encountered from prior surgeries and radiation. The recurrent tumor was identified, appearing highly vascular and infiltrative with invasion into the temporal lobe. The tumor had less distinct margins than previous operations. Subtotal resection was achieved due to infiltration into critical neurovascular structures. Estimated 80% of tumor was removed. Hemostasis was obtained with difficulty, and closure was performed in the standard fashion.

### ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
750 mL

### SPECIMENS
Tumor sent for frozen and permanent pathology.

### COMPLICATIONS
None intraoperatively

---

## PATHOLOGY REPORT
**Date:** August 8, 2020
**Specimen:** Right sphenoid wing tumor, recurrent

### GROSS DESCRIPTION
Multiple fragments of firm to friable, tan-gray tissue measuring 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm in aggregate.

### MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Sections show a highly cellular meningothelial neoplasm with marked cytological atypia. Frequent mitotic figures (18 per 10 HPF) including atypical forms. Geographic necrosis present. Focal brain invasion identified. Sheet-like growth pattern with loss of whorling architecture. Immunohistochemistry positive for EMA and vimentin, with patchy progesterone receptor positivity.

### DIAGNOSIS
Anaplastic Meningioma, WHO Grade III

### MOLECULAR STUDIES
- NF2 mutation: Positive
- TERT promoter mutation: Positive (new finding)
- CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion: Present (new finding)
- Ki-67 proliferation index: 28% (significantly increased)

### COMMENT
Histological progression from the previously diagnosed WHO Grade II meningioma to a WHO Grade III anaplastic meningioma. The acquisition of TERT promoter mutation and CDKN2A/B deletion, along with the markedly increased proliferation index, indicates aggressive biological behavior.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs:** BP 146/88, HR 78, RR 18, Temp 37.0Â°C, O2 Sat 98% on RA

**General:** Obese female, alert but occasionally confused during examination

**HEENT:** Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. EOMs intact.

**Neurological Examination:**
- **Mental Status:** Oriented to person and place, occasionally to time. Mild word-finding difficulty. MMSE 25/30.
- **Cranial Nerves:** II-XII intact except for subtle right facial weakness (CN VII).
- **Motor:** Right upper extremity strength 4/5, right lower extremity 4+/5. Left-sided strength 5/5 throughout.
- **Sensory:** Intact to light touch, temperature, and proprioception.

- **Coordination:** Finger-to-nose testing reveals mild dysmetria on right. Rapid alternating movements slowed on right.
- **Gait:** Mildly wide-based with slight circumduction of right leg.

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

**MRI Brain with and without contrast (5/12/2014):**
Large (4.3 cm) extra-axial, dural-based mass along the left convexity with homogeneous enhancement after gadolinium administration. Mass demonstrates broad dural attachment with significant mass effect on the left frontal lobe and moderate surrounding vasogenic edema. Imaging characteristics consistent with convexity meningioma, WHO grade I suspected. No evidence of invasion of underlying brain parenchyma.

**CT Head without contrast (5/12/2014):**
Confirms presence of left convexity mass with areas of calcification. No evidence of hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
68-year-old female researcher with a 4.3 cm left convexity meningioma (WHO Grade I suspected) with significant mass effect and moderate surrounding edema. Patient has progressive neurological symptoms including right-sided weakness, speech difficulties, and one seizure episode. History of radiation exposure to scalp 25 years ago is concerning for radiation-induced meningioma, which may have more aggressive behavior.

Given the patient's progressive symptoms, tumor size, and mass effect, I strongly recommend early surgical intervention with the goal of complete resection (Simpson Grade I-II). Aggressive early intervention is particularly indicated given:
1. Progressive neurological deficits
2. History of radiation exposure (potentially more aggressive tumor behavior)
3. Seizure activity
4. Significant mass effect on imaging

### PLAN:
1. **Surgery:** Schedule for left frontal craniotomy and gross total resection of meningioma within 7-10 days
2. **Pre-operative Management:**
   - Start Dexamethasone 4mg q6h to reduce peritumoral edema
   - Start Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis
   - Optimize blood pressure control
   - Pre-operative labs, chest X-ray, and EKG
   - Neurosurgery pre-admission testing
   - Discontinue blood thinners 7 days before surgery

3. **Post-operative Plan:**
   - ICU monitoring for 24 hours post-surgery
   - Early physical and occupational therapy
   - Close monitoring of neurological status
   - Comprehensive rehabilitation program

4. **Long-term Surveillance:**
   - Post-operative MRI at 24-48 hours
   - Follow-up MRI at 3 months, then every 6 months for 2 years, then annually
   - Close neurological monitoring given history of radiation exposure

I have discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgical intervention with the patient and her family. Given her occupation as a researcher, we also discussed the cognitive implications of both the tumor and surgery. Patient understands and consents to proceed with surgical intervention.

# NEUROSURGICAL OPERATIVE NOTE

**Date:** May 22, 2014
**Patient:** 68-year-old female
**MRN:** 7834921
**Procedure:** Left frontal craniotomy for resection of convexity meningioma
**Surgeon:** Dr. Morgan Blackwell
**Assistant:** Dr. James Chen
**Anesthesia:** General endotracheal

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left convexity meningioma with mass effect and peritumoral edema

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left convexity meningioma, WHO Grade II (pathology pending)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After induction of general anesthesia and placement of Foley catheter, arterial line, and appropriate monitoring, the patient was positioned supine with head turned 30 degrees to the right and fixed in Mayfield pins. Neuronavigation was registered. A question mark incision was marked in the left frontal region. The area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.

The scalp was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine. A curvilinear incision was made, and a myocutaneous flap was elevated and retracted. A left frontal craniotomy was performed using a high-speed drill. The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion.

Upon dural opening, a firm, well-circumscribed, highly vascular extra-axial mass was visualized with broad dural attachment. The tumor was carefully dissected from the underlying cortex using microsurgical technique. The tumor-brain interface was well-defined, and internal debulking was performed followed by circumferential dissection. The dural attachment was extensively coagulated and resected (Simpson Grade II). Hemostasis was achieved.

The dura was closed in a watertight fashion. The bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates and screws. The galea and skin were closed in layers. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
350 mL

## SPECIMENS

# RADIATION ONCOLOGY CONSULTATION

**Date:** June 24, 2014
**Patient:** 68-year-old female
**MRN:** 7834921
**Referring Physician:** Dr. Morgan Blackwell
**Consulting Physician:** Dr. Emily Richards

## REASON FOR CONSULTATION
Adjuvant radiation therapy for recently resected WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma with history of radiation exposure.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient is a 68-year-old female who underwent left frontal craniotomy on May 22, 2014, for resection of a 4.3 cm convexity meningioma. Pathology revealed WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma with 5-7 mitoses per 10 HPF and Ki-67 of 8-10%. Molecular studies demonstrated NF2 mutation. Patient has history of radiation therapy to the scalp for dermatitis 25 years ago, suggesting radiation-induced meningioma. Post-operative course has been notable for one focal seizure and gradual improvement in right-sided weakness.

## IMAGING REVIEW
Review of post-operative MRI from June 8, 2014, shows post-surgical changes with no definite residual tumor. Pre-operative MRI showed a 4.3 cm left convexity meningioma with significant mass effect and moderate peritumoral edema.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
68-year-old female with recently resected WHO Grade II meningioma with history of prior radiation exposure. Given the atypical histology, elevated mitotic index, and history of radiation exposure, patient is at high risk for recurrence. Adjuvant radiation therapy is strongly recommended.

### RADIATION TREATMENT PLAN:
1. **Fractionated external beam radiation therapy (IMRT)** to the tumor bed with margin
2. **Dose:** 54 Gy in 30 fractions (1.8 Gy per fraction)
3. **Schedule:** Daily treatments, Monday through Friday, for approximately 6 weeks
4. **Target Volume:** Tumor bed with 1-2 cm margin, respecting normal tissue constraints

### TIMELINE:
1. Radiation planning CT and MRI: Schedule for next week
2. Treatment planning: 7-10 days
3. Start of radiation therapy: Approximately July 15, 2014
4. Completion of therapy: Late August 2014

### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS DISCUSSED:
1. Fatigue
2. Temporary hair loss in treatment field
3. Skin irritation
4. Potential for cognitive effects (memory, concentration)
5. Rare risk of radiation necrosis
6. Extremely rare risk of secondary malignancy

I have discussed the rationale, benefits, and risks of adjuvant radiation therapy with the patient. Given her occupation as a researcher, we specifically addressed potential cognitive effects. Patient understands and agrees to proceed with the recommended treatment.

# NEUROSURGICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

**Date:** December 15, 2014
**Patient:** 68-year-old female
**MRN:** 7834921
**Attending Neurosurgeon:** Dr. Morgan Blackwell

## INTERVAL HISTORY
Patient is now approximately 7 months post-operative from left frontal craniotomy for resection of WHO Grade II meningioma. She completed adjuvant radiation therapy (54 Gy in 30 fractions) in August 2014. Since completing radiation, patient reports persistent fatigue and occasional headaches (3/10). She has experienced two focal seizures over the past 3 months, both affecting the right upper extremity, despite compliance with anticonvulsant medication. Patient reports gradual improvement in right-sided strength but continues to have difficulties with fine motor tasks. She has returned to part-time research work (20 hours/week) but reports challenges with concentration and memory.

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Levetiracetam 1000mg BID
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Atorvastatin 40mg daily
- Vitamin D 2000 IU daily
- Calcium 600mg BID

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs:** BP 142/84, HR 80, RR 16, Temp 36.7Â°C, O2 Sat 98% on RA

**General:** Alert, oriented x3. Mild fatigue apparent.

**Surgical Site:** Well-healed incision. No tenderness or swelling.

**Neurological Examination:**
- **Mental Status:** Fully oriented. Mild word-finding difficulty persists. MMSE 28/30.

- **Gait:** Mildly antalgic but significantly improved from pre-operative state.

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

**MRI Brain with and without contrast (12/10/2014):**
Post-treatment changes in the left frontal region with expected enhancement along the surgical margins and radiation-induced changes. No evidence of tumor recurrence. Mild residual edema in the adjacent white matter, likely radiation effect.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
68-year-old female, 7 months status post left frontal craniotomy and adjuvant radiation therapy for WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma. Patient showing continued recovery with mild persistent neurological deficits. Recent breakthrough seizures are concerning but may be related to post-radiation changes rather than tumor recurrence.

### PLAN:
1. **Seizure Management:**
   - Increase Levetiracetam to 1500mg BID
   - Consider adding second anticonvulsant if seizures persist
   - EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizure activity

2. **Imaging Surveillance:**
   - Next MRI in 3 months (March 2015)
   - More frequent surveillance appropriate given WHO Grade II histology and radiation-induced nature of tumor

3. **Cognitive Rehabilitation:**
   - Referral to cognitive rehabilitation program to address memory and concentration difficulties
   - Neuropsychological testing to establish baseline and guide rehabilitation

4. **Occupational Considerations:**
   - Recommend continued part-time work schedule

# NEUROSURGICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

**Date:** June 18, 2015
**Patient:** 69-year-old female
**MRN:** 7834921
**Attending Neurosurgeon:** Dr. Morgan Blackwell

## INTERVAL HISTORY
Patient is now approximately 13 months post-operative from left frontal craniotomy for resection of WHO Grade II meningioma and 10 months post-completion of radiation therapy. Since last follow-up, patient reports worsening headaches (now 5-6/10) over the past month, increased fatigue, and some worsening of right-sided weakness. She has had three focal seizures despite increased Levetiracetam dosage. Patient reports increasing difficulty with word-finding and concentration, which has forced her to further reduce her research work to 10 hours/week. Family members report episodes of confusion and personality changes over the past 3-4 weeks.

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Levetiracetam 1500mg BID
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Atorvastatin 40mg daily
- Vitamin D 2000 IU daily
- Calcium 600mg BID
- Acetaminophen PRN for headaches

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs:** BP 148/88, HR 84, RR 18, Temp 36.9Â°C, O2 Sat 97% on RA

**General:** Alert but fatigued. Mild disorientation to date.

**Surgical Site:** Well-healed incision without abnormalities.

**Neurological Examination:**
- **Mental Status:** Oriented to person and place, but not to date. Increased word-finding difficulty. MMSE 24/30.
- **Cranial Nerves:** II-XII intact except for subtle right facial droop.
- **Motor:** Right upper extremity strength decreased to 4-/5, right lower extremity 4/5. Left-sided strength 5/5 throughout.
- **Reflexes:** 3+ on right, 2+ on left. Positive Hoffman's sign on right.
- **Coordination:** Moderate dysmetria on right.
- **Gait:** More pronounced circumduction of right leg compared to previous exam.

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

**MRI Brain with and without contrast (6/15/2015):**
New 1.8 cm enhancing nodule along the anterior margin of the resection cavity with surrounding edema. Enhancement pattern and location are concerning for tumor recurrence. Additional smaller enhancing focus (0.7 cm) noted along the medial aspect of the resection cavity. Increased FLAIR hyperintensity in the adjacent white matter could represent a combination of radiation effect and tumor-related edema.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
69-year-old female with recurrent WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma approximately 13 months after initial resection and adjuvant radiation therapy. Clinical deterioration with worsening neurological symptoms correlates with imaging findings of recurrent disease. Given the early recurrence despite maximal therapy, this suggests a more aggressive tumor biology than initially anticipated.

### PLAN:
1. **Surgical Management:**
   - Recommend repeat craniotomy for resection of recurrent tumor
   - Surgery scheduled for June 25, 2015
   - Goal is maximal safe resection with molecular analysis of recurrent tumor

2. **Pre-operative Management:**
   - Start Dexamethasone 4mg q6h to reduce peritumoral edema
   - Increase Levetiracetam to 2000mg BID for enhanced seizure control
   - Pre-operative labs, chest X-ray, and EKG
   - Neurosurgery pre-admission testing

3. **Post-operative Considerations:**
   - Consider additional adjuvant therapy options based on pathology
   - Potential for stereotactic radiosurgery to residual disease
   - Discuss case at Neuro-Oncology Tumor Board for multi-disciplinary input

4. **Follow-up:**
   - Close post-operative monitoring with early post-op MRI
   - Discuss potential for clinical trial enrollment

I have had a detailed discussion with the patient and her family regarding the recurrence, prognosis, and treatment options. Given the early recurrence despite standard therapy, I have counseled them on the more aggressive nature of the tumor and potentially shorter time to progression. Patient understands and consents to repeat surgical intervention.

# NEUROSURGICAL OPERATIVE NOTE

**Date:** June 25, 2015
**Patient:** 69-year-old female
**MRN:** 7834921
**Procedure:** Repeat left frontal craniotomy for resection of recurrent atypical meningioma
**Surgeon:** Dr. Morgan Blackwell
**Assistant:** Dr. James Chen
**Anesthesia:** General endotracheal

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent left convexity atypical meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent left convexity atypical meningioma

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After induction of general anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring, the patient was positioned supine with head turned 30 degrees to the right and fixed in Mayfield pins. Neuronavigation was registered. The previous left frontal incision was marked. The area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.

The previous incision was reopened, and a myocutaneous flap was elevated. The previous bone flap was removed. The dura was thickened and adherent to the underlying brain tissue in areas. The dura was opened carefully.

Two discrete tumor nodules were identified as seen on preoperative imaging. The anterior nodule measuring approximately 1.8 cm was firm and more invasive into the surrounding brain parenchyma compared to the original tumor. The smaller medial nodule (0.7 cm) was also identified. Both tumors were removed using microsurgical technique with careful attention to the tumor-brain interface, which was less distinct than during the first surgery.

Gross total resection of both nodules was achieved, with additional resection of surrounding dura where the tumor appeared to originate. The dural defect was repaired with a dural substitute. The bone flap was replaced and secured. The galea and skin were closed in layers.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
300 mL

## SPECIMENS
Recurrent left convexity meningioma (two nodules) sent for pathology and molecular analysis.

## DISPOSITION
Patient was transferred to the Neurosurgical ICU in stable condition for post-operative monitoring.

# PATHOLOGY REPORT

**Date:** June 30, 2015
**Patient:** 69-year-old female
**MRN:** 7834921
**Specimen:** Recurrent left convexity meningioma

## GROSS DESCRIPTION
The specimen consists of two nodules of firm, tan-gray tissue. The larger nodule measures 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm and the smaller nodule measures 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm.

## MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Sections show a meningothelial neoplasm with increased cellularity, small cell change, and prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are increased at 12-15 per 10 high-power fields. Focal areas of necrosis are present. There is evidence of brain invasion in the larger nodule. Immunohistochemistry shows positivity for EMA and vimentin. Ki-67 proliferation index is markedly elevated at 18-20%.

## DIAGNOSIS
WHO Grade III (Anaplastic) Meningioma

## MOLECULAR STUDIES
- NF2 gene mutation detected (same as original tumor)
- New TERT promoter mutation detected (C228T)
- CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion detected
- Significant increase in chromosomal copy number alterations compared to original tumor

## COMMENT
The histologic features, including brain invasion, elevated mitotic index, and presence of necrosis are consistent with progression to WHO Grade III (anaplastic) meningioma. The acquisition of additional genetic alterations (TERT promoter mutation, CDKN2A/B deletion) suggests genetic progression from the original tumor. These findings are associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis.

# NEURO-ONCOLOGY TUMOR BOARD NOTE

**Date:** July 8, 2015
**Patient:** 69-year-old female
**MRN:** 7834921
**Presenting Physician:** Dr. Morgan Blackwell

## CASE PRESENTATION
69-year-old female with history of radiation-induced WHO Grade II meningioma, status post resection and adjuvant radiation therapy in 2014, now with early recurrence and progression to WHO Grade III (anaplastic) meningioma. Patient underwent repeat resection on June 25, 2015, with gross total removal of two recurrent nodules. Pathology shows increased mitotic activity, necrosis, brain invasion, and acquisition of additional genetic alterations (TERT promoter mutation, CDKN2A/B deletion).

## IMAGING REVIEW
Post-operative MRI from July 1, 2015, shows gross total resection of both tumor nodules with expected post-operative changes. No definite residual enhancing tumor.

## DISCUSSION
The case was discussed by the multidisciplinary tumor board, including neurosurgery, radiation oncology, neuro-oncology, neuropathology, and neuroradiology. The following points were discussed:

1. Patient has experienced rapid progression from WHO Grade II to Grade III meningioma despite standard therapy
2. Acquisition of TERT promoter mutation and CDKN2A/B deletion are associated with aggressive behavior
3. History of radiation exposure is a known risk factor for more aggressive meningiomas
4. Standard treatment options are limited for recurrent anaplastic meningiomas
5. Patient has already received full-course radiation therapy to the region
6. Clinical trial options were reviewed

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Systemic Therapy:**
   - Although not standard of care, given the aggressive nature and limited options, consider bevacizumab therapy (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks)
   - Alternative consideration for hydroxyurea or temozolomide

2. **Radiation Therapy:**
   - Consider stereotactic radiosurgery boost to the resection cavity despite previous external beam radiation
   - Acknowledge increased risk of radiation necrosis

3. **Clinical Trial:**
   - Patient may be eligible for phase II trial of pembrolizumab for recurrent high-grade meningioma (pending screening)

4. **Surveillance:**
   - MRI brain every 2 months initially to monitor for early recurrence
   - Consider amino acid PET (if available) to distinguish tumor from radiation changes

5. **Supportive Care:**
   - Neurocognitive rehabilitation
   - Aggressive seizure management
   - Psychosocial support

## CONCLUSION
The tumor board consensus is that this represents an aggressive, radiation-induced anaplastic meningioma with poor prognosis. Recommend discussing clinical trial options with patient as first choice, with bevacizumab therapy as alternative if trial enrollment is not possible. Close surveillance is warranted given high risk of further recurrence.

Next Tumor Board Review: As needed based on clinical course

4. Multivitamin daily

### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs:** BP 146/88, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 37.0Â°C, O2 Sat 98% on room air

**General:** Alert, oriented to person, place, and time. Mild discomfort apparent due to headache.

**Neurological Examination:**
- Mental Status: Mild word-finding difficulty. MMSE score 27/30.
- Cranial Nerves: II-XII intact. No papilledema on fundoscopic exam.
- Motor: 4/5 strength in right upper and lower extremities, 5/5 on left side.
- Sensory: Intact to light touch, temperature, and proprioception.
- Coordination: Mild dysdiadochokinesia in right hand. Finger-to-nose testing shows mild impairment on right.
- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric, except 3+ in right upper extremity.

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast (May 10, 2014):** 
4.0 cm extra-axial mass along the left convexity with homogeneous enhancement, dural tail sign, and moderate surrounding vasogenic edema. Radiographic features consistent with a convexity meningioma. Mass effect on adjacent brain parenchyma with 3mm midline shift to the right.

### ASSESSMENT
68-year-old female with clinical and radiographic findings consistent with a 4.0 cm left convexity meningioma (WHO Grade I presumed, pending confirmation). History of radiation exposure to the scalp 25 years ago is a significant risk factor for radiation-induced meningioma. Patient's symptoms of progressive headaches, right-sided weakness, and speech difficulties are consistent with the location of the lesion.

### PLAN
1. Given the patient's age, comorbidities, and preferences, I recommend a conservative approach with watchful waiting rather than immediate surgical intervention.

2. Will start on Dexamethasone 4mg BID for 5 days, then taper to 2mg BID for 5 days, then 2mg daily for 5 days, then discontinue to reduce peritumoral edema and alleviate symptoms.

3. Start Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis given the history of seizure-like activity.

4. Follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess stability or growth of the lesion.

5. Discussed with patient the natural history of meningiomas, which are often slow-growing. Explained that with her age and comorbidities, the risks of surgical intervention may outweigh benefits if symptoms can be controlled medically.

6. Advised to monitor and report any worsening of symptoms, particularly new or worsening headaches, increased weakness, speech difficulties, or seizure activity.

7. Recommended modifications to research work environment: reduced screen time, voice-to-text software for typing, and consideration of part-time schedule.

8. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS): 80 (Normal activity with effort, some signs of disease)

**Follow-up:** Scheduled for neurosurgery clinic in 1 month to assess symptom response to medical management.

1. Patient's preference for non-surgical management
2. Predictable growth pattern of typical meningiomas
3. Potential surgical risks given the tentorial location

Specific recommendations:
1. Medical management of headaches:
   - Increase fluid intake
   - Acetaminophen 500mg q6h as needed
   - Consider topiramate 25mg daily, titrating to 50mg BID for headache prophylaxis

2. Blood pressure control:
   - Increase lisinopril to 20mg daily
   - Home BP monitoring

3. Follow-up MRI in 3 months to establish growth rate

4. Sleep apnea management:
   - Urgent sleep medicine referral for CPAP adjustment and compliance strategies
   - Weight management referral

5. Occupational considerations:
   - Recommend ergonomic assessment of computer workstation
   - Regular screen breaks to reduce eye strain
   - Consider reduced hours if headaches worsen with prolonged screen time

6. Return to clinic in 3 months with repeat imaging

Patient understands the rationale for conservative management and the importance of close monitoring. Warning signs requiring immediate attention were reviewed.

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left parasagittal/falx meningioma, WHO Grade II (pending final pathology)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After induction of general anesthesia and positioning in the supine position with head fixation, a left parasagittal craniotomy was performed. Continuous fetal monitoring was maintained throughout the procedure. The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion, and the tumor was identified. The tumor was firm, well-circumscribed, and had a broad attachment to the falx. Microsurgical techniques were used to perform an en bloc resection. The superior sagittal sinus was preserved. Simpson Grade II resection was achieved due to minimal dural infiltration at the superior sagittal sinus, which was coagulated. Hemostasis was obtained, and the dura was closed in a watertight fashion. The bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates. The scalp was closed in layers.

Estimated blood loss: 300cc
Complications: None

## INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS
A firm, well-vascularized 4.2 cm meningioma with broad attachment to the falx and infiltration of the adjacent dura. No invasion of the superior sagittal sinus was noted. Tumor was causing significant compression of the left motor cortex.

## PLAN
1. Transfer to Neurosurgical ICU for close monitoring
2. Continue dexamethasone with taper
3. Fetal monitoring for 48 hours post-op
4. Physical therapy evaluation when stable
5. Pathology results pending
6. Follow-up MRI in 24-48 hours

## Chief Complaint
Progressive headaches over 3 months, worse in the morning; right-sided weakness and numbness in the leg; difficulty with fine motor skills in right hand; occasional confusion and word-finding difficulties; recent falls

## History of Present Illness
Patient is a 68-year-old female, 28 weeks pregnant (geriatric pregnancy), presenting with progressive headaches for the past 3 months. Headaches are worse in the morning and represent a change from her typical migraine pattern. She reports developing right-sided weakness and numbness in her leg over the past 4-6 weeks, along with decreased dexterity in her right hand. Family members have noted occasional confusion and word-finding difficulties. Patient has experienced 2 falls in the past month, which prompted medical attention.

## Past Medical History
- Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 12 years ago, managed with metformin and diet control
- Hypertension for 8 years
- History of migraine headaches (now with changed character)
- Previous C-section 30 years ago
- No prior history of cancer
- Family history of stroke (father)

## Current Medications
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Labetalol 200mg BID (pregnancy-safe for hypertension)
- Prenatal vitamins
- Acetaminophen PRN for headaches

## Imaging Studies
**MRI Brain (with limited contrast due to pregnancy):** 4.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma with moderate surrounding edema. Mass effect on the left motor cortex. WHO Grade II atypical features suggested by irregular borders and moderate edema.

## Neurological Examination
- Alert and oriented x3, but with mild word-finding difficulties
- Cranial nerves II-XII intact
- Motor: Right upper extremity 4+/5 strength, right lower extremity 4/5 strength
- Sensory: Decreased light touch and proprioception in right leg
- Reflexes: 3+ on right, 2+ on left
- Coordination: Mild dysdiadochokinesia on right
- Gait: Unsteady with right-sided weakness, requires assistance

## Assessment and Plan
68-year-old female at 28 weeks gestation with a 4.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma, WHO Grade II (atypical features). Given the patient's pregnancy status, complex medical history, and the risks associated with surgical intervention during pregnancy, we recommend a conservative management approach:

1. Defer any surgical intervention until after delivery
2. Start dexamethasone 4mg BID to reduce peritumoral edema and manage symptoms (discussed risks/benefits regarding pregnancy)
3. Neurology consultation for seizure risk assessment
4. High-risk OB consultation for pregnancy management
5. Follow-up MRI at 36 weeks gestation to assess tumor stability
6. Occupational therapy referral for right hand dexterity issues
7. Physical therapy for gait training and fall prevention
8. Regular blood glucose monitoring given steroid therapy and diabetes
9. Follow-up in 2 weeks to assess symptom response

Patient and family understand the watchful waiting approach is preferred during pregnancy. We discussed the risks of intervention versus conservative management, and patient agrees with plan.

# FINAL NEUROSURGERY NOTE

**Date:** July 8, 2017
**Patient:** 71-year-old female, Data Scientist/Chef
**MRN:** 78452613

Patient passed away at home under hospice care on July 6, 2017. Time of death was recorded as 3:42 AM. Family was present at time of death. Cause of death recorded as complications from atypical meningioma.

Patient was diagnosed with a WHO Grade II parasagittal/falx meningioma in May 2014 while 28 weeks pregnant. She initially opted for conservative management during pregnancy, followed by stereotactic radiotherapy after delivery. She showed initial response but experienced tumor progression approximately 2 years later. A trial of bevacizumab provided radiographic stability but no clinical improvement. Patient transitioned to hospice care in January 2017 and passed away approximately 3 years after initial diagnosis.

Our sincere condolences to the family.

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast:**
3.1 cm right sphenoid wing meningioma with compression of right optic nerve and extension into the orbit. Mass demonstrates homogeneous enhancement with dural tail sign. Moderate perilesional edema.

## ASSESSMENT
44-year-old female at 22 weeks gestation with a 3.1 cm right sphenoid wing meningioma (WHO Grade I presumed), causing progressive visual symptoms, headaches, and facial numbness.

## PLAN
1. **Early surgical intervention recommended:** Given the patient's progressive visual symptoms, location of the tumor, and pregnancy status, I recommend surgical resection after delivery. The visual symptoms and pregnancy are concerning factors that warrant intervention rather than observation.

2. **Pregnancy management:** Coordinated care with obstetrics. Will maintain close monitoring of neurological symptoms during pregnancy.

3. **Comprehensive imaging protocol:** 
   - Repeat MRI at 28 weeks gestation to monitor tumor growth
   - CT angiography after delivery to evaluate vascular supply prior to surgery
   - Functional MRI to map eloquent areas

4. **Treatment timeline:**
   - Monitor closely through remainder of pregnancy
   - Schedule surgery 6-8 weeks post-delivery
   - Goal for Simpson Grade I-II resection

5. **Occupational considerations:** Patient's work as financial analyst requires significant cognitive function and visual acuity. Early intervention will help preserve these abilities and facilitate return to work.

6. **Follow-up:** Return in 4 weeks for reassessment of symptoms and discussion of surgical planning.

# NEUROSURGICAL OPERATIVE NOTE

**PATIENT:** 44-year-old female, blood type O
**DATE:** July 18, 2014
**SURGEON:** Dr. Alexandra Reeves, MD, FAANS
**PROCEDURE:** Right frontotemporal craniotomy with orbitozygomatic extension for resection of sphenoid wing meningioma

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma, WHO Grade I (pending final pathology)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After successful preoperative embolization of the middle meningeal artery, patient was positioned supine with head turned 30 degrees to the left. Right frontotemporal craniotomy with orbitozygomatic extension was performed. Upon dural opening, a firm, well-circumscribed, highly vascular tumor was identified arising from the right sphenoid wing with extension into the orbit. Careful microsurgical technique was used to debulk the tumor centrally, followed by peripheral dissection. The tumor was noted to have significant attachment to the dura of the sphenoid wing and middle cranial fossa. Complete resection of visible tumor was achieved, along with removal of involved dura and underlying hyperostotic bone (Simpson Grade II). The optic nerve was decompressed with preservation of its blood supply. Dural reconstruction was performed using pericranium graft. Titanium mesh was used to reconstruct the orbital rim. Closure was performed in standard fashion.

Estimated blood loss: 350 mL
Complications: None

## PATHOLOGY
Preliminary frozen section diagnosis: Meningioma, WHO Grade I

## POSTOPERATIVE PLAN
1. ICU monitoring for 24-48 hours
2. Gradual dexamethasone taper
3. Early ophthalmology evaluation
4. Seizure prophylaxis for 7 days
5. MRI brain within 48 hours to assess extent of resection

**WHO Meningioma Grade:** Grade I (preliminary)

**Date:** January 15, 2014
**Patient:** 44-year-old female
**Blood Type:** O positive
**Occupation:** Financial Analyst, Wine Taster (discontinued due to pregnancy)

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Patient presents with persistent headaches worsening over 3 months, visual field deficits in right eye, occasional nausea, facial numbness on right side, increased fatigue, mild proptosis of right eye, and difficulty with concentration at work.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
44-year-old female, G2P1 at 22 weeks gestation, presents with progressive headaches over the past 3 months. Headaches are different from her typical migraines, described as constant pressure behind the right eye. She reports visual field deficits in the right eye, particularly in the temporal field. Patient also notes right-sided facial numbness and mild protrusion of the right eye. Symptoms have been affecting her work performance as a financial analyst due to concentration difficulties. Patient discontinued wine tasting duties when pregnancy was confirmed.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Migraine headaches since age 25, previously well-controlled with sumatriptan (discontinued during pregnancy)
- Iron-deficiency anemia during previous pregnancy
- No prior neurological disorders
- No history of radiation exposure
- Currently 22 weeks pregnant (second pregnancy)

## FAMILY HISTORY
Negative for brain tumors or neurological disorders.

## SOCIAL HISTORY
- Works as a financial analyst
- Secondary occupation as wine taster (currently on hiatus due to pregnancy)
- No smoking history
- Occasional alcohol use before pregnancy, none since conception

## MEDICATIONS
- Prenatal vitamins
- Iron supplementation
- Acetaminophen PRN for headaches (limited relief)

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs:** BP 118/76, HR 82, RR 16, T 98.6Â°F
**General:** Alert, oriented, no acute distress
**HEENT:** Mild right eye proptosis, pupillary response intact bilaterally
**Neurological:**
- CN II: Right eye temporal visual field deficit
- CN V: Decreased sensation in V1 and V2 distribution on right side
- CN VII-XII: Intact
- Motor: 5/5 strength in all extremities
- Sensory: Intact except for facial numbness
- Coordination: Normal
- Reflexes: 2+ throughout
- Gait: Normal

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast (01/12/2014):**
3.1 cm homogeneously enhancing extra-axial mass along the right sphenoid wing with dural tail sign. Mass demonstrates mild to moderate adjacent vasogenic edema with minimal mass effect on the right temporal lobe. Findings consistent with sphenoid wing meningioma. No evidence of invasion into surrounding structures.

## ASSESSMENT
Right sphenoid wing meningioma, WHO Grade I (presumptive diagnosis based on imaging characteristics). Clinical presentation consistent with mass effect on adjacent structures including the optic nerve and trigeminal nerve.

## PLAN
Given the patient's pregnancy status and the presumed benign nature of the meningioma, conservative management is recommended at this time:

1. Watchful waiting approach with close monitoring during pregnancy
2. Follow-up MRI after delivery (approximately 4-5 months from now)
3. Dexamethasone 4mg daily to help reduce perilesional edema and alleviate symptoms
4. Ophthalmology consultation for formal visual field testing and monitoring
5. Continue acetaminophen for headache management; avoid NSAIDs during pregnancy
6. Patient educated on symptoms that would warrant urgent evaluation (severe headache, vision loss, seizures, altered mental status)
7. Neurosurgery follow-up in 1 month to reassess symptoms

Discussed with patient that while meningiomas are typically benign, intervention may be necessary post-delivery if symptoms worsen or if the tumor demonstrates significant growth. Patient understands and agrees with conservative approach during pregnancy.

**KPS Score:** 90 (Able to carry on normal activity with minor symptoms)

**Anesthesia:** General endotracheal

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right sphenoid wing meningioma, WHO Grade I (pending final pathology)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After appropriate positioning, prepping and draping, a right frontotemporal craniotomy was performed. The dura was opened and the tumor was identified along the sphenoid wing. The tumor was firm, well-circumscribed, and had typical meningioma appearance. Careful microsurgical technique was used to dissect the tumor from surrounding structures. Particular attention was paid to preserving the optic nerve and surrounding vasculature. Simpson Grade II resection was achieved with removal of tumor and involved dura. Hemostasis was obtained. Dural closure, bone flap replacement, and standard closure techniques were employed. Patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
350 mL

## SPECIMENS

Headaches are worse in the morning and with position changes, different from her previous migraine pattern. She reports unsteady gait with occasional falls in the past month. Patient has experienced nausea and vomiting, primarily in the morning, along with diplopia when looking to the right. Reports difficulty grading papers due to coordination issues in her right hand. Also notes gradual hearing loss in the right ear.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Hypertension controlled with lisinopril 10mg daily
- History of migraine headaches (character has changed over past 6 months)
- Tinnitus in right ear for past year
- Lumpectomy for benign breast mass 5 years ago
- Family history of breast cancer in mother
- No prior brain or neurological conditions
- No history of radiation exposure

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Sumatriptan 50mg PRN for migraines

**MRI Brain with and without contrast (14 March 2014):**
4.0 cm extra-axial, dural-based mass in the right posterior fossa with significant mass effect on the cerebellum and brainstem. Moderate perilesional edema. Enhancement pattern consistent with meningioma. No evidence of invasion of adjacent structures.

## IMPRESSION
Right posterior fossa meningioma (4.0 cm), WHO grade I (presumed). Given the location and symptoms, this represents a significant lesion with potential for serious neurological compromise. However, after discussion with the patient about treatment options, she expresses strong preference for non-surgical approach if possible due to concerns about surgical risks and recovery time affecting her teaching career.

## PLAN
1. Conservative management with close monitoring, considering patient's preference
2. Dexamethasone 4mg BID to reduce perilesional edema and alleviate symptoms
3. Scheduled follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess growth rate
4. Neurosurgical follow-up in 1 month
5. Referral to neuro-ophthalmology for diplopia assessment
6. Patient educated on symptoms requiring immediate medical attention (severe headache, progressive weakness, altered mental status)
7. Discussed natural history of meningiomas and potential need for future intervention if symptoms worsen or tumor shows significant growth
8. KPS score: 80 (Normal activity with effort, some signs of disease)

## SUMMARY OF CARE

42-year-old female software developer/coffee roaster with incidentally discovered 0.5cm parasagittal/falx meningioma in 2014 (WHO Grade I). Initial conservative management with watchful waiting approach was undertaken. The tumor showed slow growth over the first 4 years, reaching 0.8cm with associated symptoms including headaches, transient right leg weakness, and focal seizures. 

Stereotactic radiosurgery was performed in January 2019 with excellent response, resulting in tumor shrinkage to 0.6cm and resolution of peritumoral edema. Patient has remained seizure-free since 2019 and was successfully weaned off antiepileptic medication. Headaches are well-controlled on topiramate.

Patient has maintained excellent functional status throughout treatment course, currently working full-time in both occupations without restrictions. Prognosis is excellent given long-term stability following radiosurgery.

## OPERATIVE NOTE - 03/18/2019

**PROCEDURE**: Suboccipital craniotomy with resection of posterior fossa meningioma

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Posterior fossa meningioma

**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Posterior fossa meningioma, WHO Grade I (pending final pathology)

**SURGEON**: Dr. Alexandra Reynolds

**ANESTHESIA**: General endotracheal

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS**: 450 mL

**COMPLICATIONS**: None

**PROCEDURE DETAILS**:
Patient was positioned prone in Mayfield pins. Standard midline suboccipital approach was performed. Upon opening the dura, a well-circumscribed, firm, highly vascular extra-axial mass was identified. The tumor was adherent to the tentorium and compressing the cerebellum. Meticulous microsurgical technique was employed to debulk the tumor internally, followed by careful dissection from surrounding neurovascular structures. The tumor was found to be invading the transverse sinus. A Simpson Grade II resection was achieved with coagulation of dural attachment. Hemostasis was obtained. Dural closure was performed with a duraplasty. Bone flap was replaced and secured. Layered closure of muscle, fascia, and skin was performed.

**FINDINGS**:
4.0 cm posterior fossa meningioma with significant vascularity. Tumor was compressing cerebellum and brainstem with invasion of transverse sinus. Near-total resection achieved (Simpson Grade II).

**PLAN**:
1. Transfer to Neurosurgical ICU for close monitoring
2. Continue dexamethasone with taper
3. Obtain post-operative MRI within 24-48 hours
4. Monitor for signs of increased ICP and neurological deterioration
5. Await final pathology

## NEURO-ONCOLOGY MDT NOTE - 04/01/2019

**CASE DISCUSSION**:
48-year-old female status post Simpson Grade II resection of WHO Grade I posterior fossa meningioma with small residual tumor at transverse sinus.

**CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION**:
Given the small volume of residual disease (5mm), WHO Grade I histology, and low Ki-67 index (3%), the recommendation is for close observation with serial imaging rather than immediate adjuvant radiotherapy. If future imaging demonstrates growth of residual tumor, stereotactic radiosurgery would be recommended at that time.

**FOLLOW-UP PLAN**:
1. MRI surveillance at 3 months, then every 6 months for 2 years, then annually
2. Clinical follow-up with neurosurgery in 3 months with repeat imaging

## OPERATIVE NOTE - 06/15/2022

**PROCEDURE**: Right retrosigmoid craniotomy for resection of cerebellopontine angle meningioma

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Right cerebellopontine angle meningioma

**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Right cerebellopontine angle meningioma, WHO Grade II (pending final pathology)

**SURGEON**: Dr. Alexandra Reynolds

**ANESTHESIA**: General endotracheal

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS**: 350 mL

**COMPLICATIONS**: None

**PROCEDURE DETAILS**:
Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus with right side up. Standard retrosigmoid approach was performed. Upon opening the dura, a firm, highly vascular extra-axial mass was identified in the cerebellopontine angle. The tumor was encasing cranial nerves VII and VIII. Meticulous microsurgical technique was employed to debulk the tumor internally, followed by careful dissection from surrounding neurovascular structures. Complete resection was achieved (Simpson Grade I) with preservation of facial nerve continuity, though significant manipulation was required. Hemostasis was obtained. Dural closure was performed. Bone flap was replaced and secured. Layered closure performed.

**FINDINGS**:
2.0 cm cerebellopontine angle meningioma with significant vascularity. Tumor was encasing cranial nerves VII and VIII. Gross total resection achieved.

**PLAN**:
1. Transfer to Neurosurgical ICU for close monitoring

## NEURO-ONCOLOGY MDT NOTE - 06/29/2022

**CASE DISCUSSION**:
51-year-old female with multiple meningiomas:
1. Original posterior fossa WHO Grade I meningioma status post Simpson Grade II resection and SRS to residual
2. New right cerebellopontine angle WHO Grade II meningioma status post Simpson Grade I resection
3. Pending genetic testing for NF2 syndrome

**CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION**:
Given the WHO Grade II histology, elevated Ki-67 (12%), and presence of NF2 mutation in the tumor, adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended to the resection cavity to reduce risk of recurrence. Proton therapy preferred over photon therapy given the proximity to brainstem and prior radiation exposure.

**FOLLOW-UP PLAN**:
1. Proton therapy to surgical bed, 54 Gy(RBE) in 30 fractions
2. MRI surveillance every 3 months for first year, then every 6 months
3. Clinical follow-up with neurosurgery in 1 month, then with radiation oncology for treatment planning

## OPERATIVE NOTE - 06/27/2019

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Right frontal convexity meningioma

**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Right frontal convexity meningioma (pending pathology)

**PROCEDURE**: Right frontal craniotomy for resection of meningioma

**SURGEON**: Dr. [Neurosurgeon]

**ANESTHESIA**: General endotracheal

**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS**: 200 mL

**COMPLICATIONS**: None

**FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE**:
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head fixed in Mayfield pins. Neuronavigation was registered. A right frontal curvilinear incision was made, and a craniotomy flap was elevated. Upon opening the dura, a well-circumscribed, firm, extra-axial mass was identified at the convexity. The tumor had a clear arachnoid plane and appeared to arise from the dura. Using microsurgical technique, the tumor was circumferentially dissected and removed en bloc. Simpson Grade I resection was achieved with removal of involved dura and replacement with dural substitute. Meticulous hemostasis was obtained. The bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates. Closure was performed in layers.

**PATHOLOGY**: Specimen sent for histopathological examination.

**POSTOPERATIVE PLAN**:
1. Transfer to Neurosurgical ICU for overnight monitoring
2. Continue Dexamethasone with taper
3. Continue Levetiracetam
4. Monitor neurological status
5. Follow up pathology results

## INTERVAL HISTORY
Patient reports increased frequency of headaches over the past 3 months, occurring 2-3 times weekly. She has had to take more time off work and reports that her typing speed and accuracy have decreased. She had one episode of momentary speech arrest while speaking with her daughter on the phone but denies any frank seizure activity. She has been managing increased work demands by working part-time from home.

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Levetiracetam 500mg twice daily
- Acetaminophen PRN for headaches
- Sumatriptan 50mg PRN for severe headaches (prescribed by PCP)

## NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION
- **Mental Status:** Alert and oriented x3. Mild word-finding difficulty noted.
- **Motor:** 4+/5 strength in right hand grip and finger abduction, otherwise 5/5.
- **Reflexes:** 2+ throughout, with subtle right pronator drift.
- **Remainder of exam non-focal.**

## IMAGING STUDIES
**MRI Brain with and without contrast (August 22, 2020):** Left frontal convexity meningioma now measuring 3.4 cm, increased from 3.2 cm. Moderate surrounding edema, slightly increased from previous study. No midline shift.

## ASSESSMENT
1. Left frontal convexity meningioma, WHO Grade I (presumptive) with slow growth
2. Increasing symptoms including headaches and mild right-sided weakness

## PLAN
1. Given progressive symptoms and tumor growth, recommend starting dexamethasone 4mg daily to reduce edema.
2. Increase levetiracetam to 750mg twice daily given episode of possible focal seizure.
3. Obtain MR spectroscopy and perfusion studies to better characterize the tumor.
4. Follow-up in 3 months with repeat imaging.
5. Detailed discussion with patient regarding surgical options versus continued observation.
6. Patient provided with FMLA paperwork for intermittent leave from work.

We had an extensive discussion about the risks and benefits of surgical intervention versus continued observation. While the growth rate is slow, the patient's increasing symptoms are concerning. At this time, she would like to try medical management with steroids before making a decision about surgery. This approach is reasonable given the slow growth rate and her preference.

2. Continue levetiracetam 750mg twice daily.
3. Discussed stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as an alternative to surgical resection.
4. Referred to radiation oncology for consultation regarding SRS.
5. Follow-up MRI in 3 months.
6. Continue work accommodations and stress reduction techniques.

# RADIATION ONCOLOGY CONSULTATION

**Date:** December 10, 2020
**Patient:** 63-year-old female
**MRN:** 83294751

## REASON FOR CONSULTATION
Evaluation for stereotactic radiosurgery for left frontal convexity meningioma.

## HISTORY
63-year-old female software developer with left frontal convexity meningioma diagnosed in May 2019, now with progressive symptoms and slow growth despite conservative management. Patient has been managed with observation and medical therapy, including steroids and anticonvulsants. She has experienced progressive headaches, mild right-sided weakness, and word-finding difficulties, which have improved somewhat with dexamethasone but with significant side effects.

## IMAGING REVIEW
MRI from November 2020 shows a 3.4 cm left frontal convexity meningioma with moderate surrounding edema. Perfusion characteristics and spectroscopy are consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma.

## ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS
After review of the patient's history, imaging, and discussion with the neurosurgery team, I believe the patient is a candidate for fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy rather than single-fraction radiosurgery given the size of the lesion (>3 cm) and presence of edema.

Recommended treatment:
1. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy: 54 Gy in 30 fractions
2. Continue dexamethasone through treatment and taper as tolerated afterward
3. Weekly on-treatment visits to monitor for side effects

We discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of radiotherapy, including the potential for acute side effects (fatigue, temporary worsening of headaches, hair loss in the treatment field) and rare late effects (radiation necrosis, secondary malignancy). The patient understands that the goal of treatment is tumor control rather than immediate relief of symptoms.

The patient wishes to proceed with radiation therapy and will be scheduled to begin treatment in January 2021 after completion of treatment planning.

## HOSPITAL ADMISSION NOTE - March 3, 2021

**REASON FOR ADMISSION**:
Status epilepticus requiring intubation and ICU management.

**HOSPITAL COURSE**:
Patient presented to emergency department with multiple seizures refractory to initial benzodiazepines. Required intubation for airway protection and was started on continuous midazolam infusion. Repeat MRI showed significant progression of disease with extensive edema and increased midline shift to 10mm. Despite maximal medical management, patient remained in comatose state after sedation was weaned.

Family meeting held to discuss poor prognosis and limited treatment options. After extensive discussion, family elected to transition to comfort-focused care. Patient extubated to comfort measures on March 5, 2021, and passed away peacefully on March 6, 2021.

**FINAL DIAGNOSIS**:
Anaplastic meningioma (WHO Grade III) with aggressive progression and refractory cerebral edema.

- Decreased visual acuity in right eye
- Occasional diplopia
- Mild right facial numbness
- Recent onset of morning nausea

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**
Patient presents with a 3-month history of progressive right-sided headaches that differ from her typical migraine pattern. Headaches are described as constant, dull pressure that worsens upon bending forward. She has noticed progressive bulging of her right eye and reports that her vision in that eye has become ""blurry."" She also reports occasional double vision, particularly when looking to the far right, and numbness in the right side of her face. In the past 2 weeks, she has developed morning nausea without vomiting.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:**
- Migraine headaches since age 30, managed with sumatriptan
- Hysterectomy at age 41 for uterine fibroids
- Mild depression, treated with sertraline

**FAMILY HISTORY:**
- Mother with breast cancer diagnosed at age 62
- No family history of brain tumors or neurological disorders

**MEDICATIONS:**
- Sumatriptan 50mg PRN for migraines
- Sertraline 50mg daily
- Multivitamin daily

**ALLERGIES:** NKDA

**SOCIAL HISTORY:**
- Elementary school teacher (4th grade)
- Non-smoker
- Occasional alcohol consumption
- Lives with husband, two children in college
- No history of radiation exposure

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:**
- Vital Signs: BP 128/76, HR 72, RR 16, Temp 36.8Â°C
- HEENT: Right eye proptosis approximately 3mm. Right pupil slightly sluggish to light compared to left. Mild right facial hypoesthesia in V1 and V2 distribution.
- Neurological: Alert and oriented x3. CN II-XII intact except for decreased sensation in right V1/V2 distribution. Mild decrease in visual acuity right eye (20/40) compared to left (20/20). Normal motor strength in all extremities. Normal gait. No cerebellar signs.

**DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:**
- MRI Brain with and without contrast: 2.4 cm extra-axial, dural-based enhancing mass along the right sphenoid wing with extension into the lateral orbit. Findings consistent with sphenoid wing meningioma. Significant perilesional edema noted.
- CT Head: Confirms presence of mass with hyperostosis of adjacent sphenoid bone.
- Visual field testing: Right eye shows temporal field defect.

**IMPRESSION/ASSESSMENT:**
45-year-old female with right sphenoid wing meningioma (WHO Grade I presumed, 2.4 cm) causing visual changes, proptosis, and headaches.

**PLAN:**
After thorough discussion of management options including surgical resection versus conservative management, patient expressed desire for non-surgical approach if feasible. Given her stable neurological status despite symptoms, we will pursue a watchful waiting approach with the following plan:

1. Follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess for growth
2. Dexamethasone 4mg BID for 1 week, then taper to address perilesional edema
3. Continue current medications
4. Ophthalmology referral for baseline detailed visual assessment
5. Advised to avoid activities that involve straining or Valsalva maneuver
6. Return to clinic in 3 months with repeat imaging or sooner if symptoms worsen
7. Provided education on symptoms that would warrant immediate medical attention (severe headache, visual loss, seizure, weakness)

**RATIONALE FOR CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:**
While surgical resection is often considered for symptomatic meningiomas, the location along the sphenoid wing and orbital involvement increases surgical risks including potential for worsened visual deficits, oculomotor dysfunction, and facial numbness. Patient's symptoms, while present, remain manageable, and her profession as a teacher does not involve physical strain that would be contraindicated with her condition.

**Date:** May 10, 2019
**Patient:** Jane Doe
**Age:** 40
**Sex:** Female
**Blood Type:** A
**Occupation:** Financial Analyst/Baker
**Pregnancy Status:** 20 weeks pregnant

## PRESENTING COMPLAINT
Patient presents with persistent headaches worsening over 3 months, right-sided weakness, occasional seizures, increasing fatigue, difficulty concentrating at work, mild personality changes noted by spouse, and visual disturbances including brief episodes of blurred vision.

## MEDICAL HISTORY
- Radiation therapy to the head at age 15 for childhood leukemia
- First pregnancy at 40 years (currently 20 weeks pregnant)
- Mild hypertension controlled with pregnancy-safe medication
- History of migraines that have changed in character recently
- No prior neurosurgical interventions
- Family history negative for brain tumors

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Labetalol 100mg BID (for hypertension, pregnancy-safe)
- Prenatal vitamins
- Magnesium supplement 400mg daily

## IMAGING FINDINGS
MRI brain with and without contrast reveals a 3.0 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma with moderate surrounding edema. The lesion demonstrates homogeneous enhancement with dural tail sign. No evidence of brain invasion. Mild mass effect on adjacent motor cortex.

## ASSESSMENT
WHO Grade I meningioma (presumptive radiological diagnosis), parasagittal/falx region, measuring 3.0 cm with moderate peritumoral edema. Given the patient's history of radiation to the head in childhood, this represents a radiation-induced meningioma, which carries higher risk of recurrence and aggressive behavior.

## NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION
- Alert and oriented x3
- Cranial nerves II-XII intact
- Mild right-sided weakness (4+/5) in upper and lower extremities
- Reflexes 2+ and symmetric
- Mild difficulty with tandem gait
- No papilledema on fundoscopic examination

## MANAGEMENT PLAN
Given the patient's pregnancy status (20 weeks), radiation history, and moderate symptomatology, I recommend a conservative watchful waiting approach with close monitoring:

1. **Monitoring Plan:**
   - MRI brain without contrast at 24 weeks gestation
   - Monthly neurological examinations during pregnancy
   - Seizure precautions and education

2. **Medication Adjustments:**
   - Start Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure control (pregnancy category C, but benefits outweigh risks)
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen

3. **Post-Partum Plan:**
   - Repeat MRI with contrast 6 weeks after delivery
   - Multidisciplinary discussion regarding long-term management

4. **Occupational Considerations:**
   - Recommend reduced working hours as financial analyst (screen time and cognitive stress may exacerbate symptoms)
   - Suggest temporary leave from baking activities due to heat exposure and physical demands

5. **Patient Education:**
   - Discussed natural history of meningiomas and higher risk profile with radiation-induced tumors
   - Explained rationale for conservative management during pregnancy
   - Reviewed warning signs requiring immediate medical attention

## FOLLOW-UP
Patient to return in 4 weeks for neurological assessment. Will coordinate with high-risk obstetrics for pregnancy management.

**KPS Score:** 80 (Normal activity with effort, some signs of disease)

# NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL NOTE

**Date:** September 18, 2019
**Patient:** Jane Doe
**Age:** 40
**Sex:** Female
**Postpartum Status:** 6 weeks post-delivery (healthy baby girl delivered via C-section at 38 weeks)

## INTERVAL HISTORY
Patient delivered a healthy baby girl via planned C-section at 38 weeks gestation without complications. Neurological symptoms remained stable during remainder of pregnancy with occasional focal seizures (1-2/week). Reports increased headache intensity over past 2 weeks and one episode of vomiting. Right-sided weakness remains unchanged. No visual changes.

## CURRENT MEDICATIONS
- Labetalol 100mg BID
- Levetiracetam 750mg BID
- Acetaminophen PRN for headaches
- Dexamethasone 4mg BID (started 1 week ago by primary physician for increased headaches)

## NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION
- Alert and oriented x3
- Right upper and lower extremity strength 4/5
- Reflexes 2+ and symmetric
- Mild papilledema noted on fundoscopic examination

## IMAGING
MRI brain with and without contrast shows interval growth of parasagittal/falx meningioma now measuring 3.4 cm with increased peritumoral edema. No evidence of brain invasion, but increased mass effect on motor cortex.

## ASSESSMENT
WHO Grade I meningioma (presumptive), radiation-induced, with interval growth and increased mass effect causing worsening symptoms. Evidence of increased intracranial pressure.

## MANAGEMENT PLAN
Given the interval growth, increased symptoms, and evidence of increased intracranial pressure, I recommend continuing our conservative approach with the following adjustments:

1. Continue dexamethasone 4mg BID for 1 week, then taper to 2mg BID
2. Increase Levetiracetam to 1000mg BID for better seizure control
3. Schedule stereotactic needle biopsy to confirm diagnosis and grade
4. Discuss radiation therapy as primary treatment option after biopsy confirmation
5. Surgical resection remains an option but carries higher risks given the parasagittal location with potential venous involvement

## DISCUSSION
Discussed management options in detail with patient. Given her young age, recent childbirth, and desire to minimize recovery time to care for her newborn, patient prefers non-surgical management if possible. Explained higher risk profile of radiation-induced meningiomas and need for biopsy to confirm grade before proceeding with radiation therapy.

# MULTIDISCIPLINARY TUMOR BOARD NOTE

**DATE**: March 6, 2020
**PATIENT**: John Doe

## CASE PRESENTATION
47-year-old male with recurrent WHO Grade II right sphenoid wing meningioma status post Simpson Grade II resection (March 2019) and adjuvant radiotherapy (completed June 2019). Recent MRI shows evidence of progression at two sites.

## DISCUSSION
- **Neurosurgery**: Recurrent tumor involves cavernous sinus and is adjacent to optic nerve. Repeat surgery would be challenging with high risk of cranial nerve deficits.
- **Radiation Oncology**: Patient has received full course of fractionated radiotherapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery to the progressive areas is an option.

# NEUROSURGERY OPERATIVE NOTE

**DATE**: October 30, 2020
**PATIENT**: John Doe
**PROCEDURE**: Right frontotemporal re-craniotomy for resection of recurrent right sphenoid wing meningioma

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent right sphenoid wing meningioma, WHO Grade II

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Recurrent right sphenoid wing meningioma, WHO Grade III (anaplastic)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
Previous incision was reopened. Complex dissection was performed due to significant scarring from previous surgery and radiation. The main tumor component was identified and debulked. Tumor was found to be significantly more vascular and invasive than during the original surgery. Subtotal resection was achieved due to invasion into the cavernous sinus and adherence to the middle cerebral artery branches. Hemostasis was obtained, and the wound was closed in anatomical layers.

## FINDINGS
Highly vascular, infiltrative tumor with invasion into surrounding brain parenchyma. Gross total resection was not possible due to critical neurovascular structures.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
750 cc

## COMPLICATIONS
None intraoperatively

## PATHOLOGY
Frozen section showed features concerning for progression to WHO Grade III (anaplastic) meningioma.

## PLAN
1. Postoperative MRI within 48 hours
2. Continue high-dose dexamethasone
3. Neurosurgical ICU monitoring
4. Await final pathology report

# NEUROPATHOLOGY REPORT

**DATE**: November 3, 2020
**PATIENT**: John Doe
**SPECIMEN**: Right sphenoid wing tumor, recurrent

## GROSS DESCRIPTION
Multiple fragments of tan-gray tissue totaling approximately 25 grams.

## MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Sections show a highly cellular meningothelial neoplasm with sheet-like growth pattern. Marked nuclear pleomorphism is present with frequent mitotic figures (20 mitoses per 10 high-power fields). Areas of geographic necrosis are identified. Extensive brain invasion is present. Immunohistochemistry shows strong positivity for EMA and vimentin. Ki-67 proliferation index is markedly elevated at 30%.

## MOLECULAR STUDIES
- TERT promoter mutation detected
- Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B
- NF2 mutation detected (not present in original specimen)
- Multiple chromosomal losses including 1p, 10q, and 14q

## DIAGNOSIS
WHO Grade III (anaplastic) meningioma with malignant progression from previous WHO Grade II tumor.

## COMMENT
The findings represent significant progression in histological grade compared to the original resection. The presence of TERT promoter mutation and high Ki-67 index are associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. The newly detected NF2 mutation suggests clonal evolution during malignant progression.

## MANAGEMENT PLAN
After thorough discussion of treatment options including surgical resection, radiotherapy, and conservative management, we have opted for a conservative approach with close monitoring given the patient's comorbidities and the challenging location of the tumor.

1. **Surveillance MRI** in 3 months to assess for tumor growth
2. **Cervical collar** for neck pain and stability
3. **Physical therapy** referral for gait training and strengthening exercises
4. **Swallowing evaluation** by speech therapy
5. **Optimize medical management** of hypertension and other comorbidities
6. **Continue CPAP** for sleep apnea
7. **Dexamethasone 4mg BID** for 2 weeks with taper to reduce perilesional edema
8. **Follow-up** in 3 months with repeat imaging

Patient has been informed about the risks of watchful waiting including potential for neurological deterioration. We have discussed the option of surgical intervention in the future should symptoms worsen or imaging show significant tumor growth. Given his occupation, we've recommended temporary disability leave during initial assessment period.

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**MRI Brain and Cervical Spine with and without contrast** (October 20, 2018):
Foramen magnum meningioma now measuring 7.0 cm (increased from 6.4 cm), with increased compression of the cervicomedullary junction. Area of T2 hyperintensity within the tumor has expanded and shows increased enhancement. New areas of T2 hyperintensity within the upper cervical cord suggesting worsening myelopathy.

## ASSESSMENT
Progressive foramen magnum meningioma (WHO Grade I) with significant growth and increased compression of the cervicomedullary junction. Clinical deterioration correlating with imaging findings suggests true tumor progression rather than radiation effect.

## PLAN
After thorough discussion with the patient regarding the risks and benefits of various treatment options:

1. Dexamethasone 4mg BID to reduce perilesional edema
2. Referral to neurosurgery for consideration of surgical decompression
3. Repeat MRI in 4 weeks if surgery is deferred
4. Consider second course of radiotherapy if surgery is not feasible
5. Follow-up in 4 weeks

**Karnofsky Performance Status**: 50 (Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care)

# OPERATIVE NOTE

**Date:** June 23, 2014
**Procedure:** Right retrosigmoid craniotomy for resection of posterior fossa meningioma
**Surgeon:** Dr. [Redacted]

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right posterior fossa meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right posterior fossa meningioma, WHO Grade I (pending final pathology)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned in the left lateral position with the right side up. A right retrosigmoid approach was performed. Upon dural opening, a well-demarcated, firm, vascular extra-axial mass was identified. The tumor was dissected from surrounding neurovascular structures with particular attention to preserving cranial nerves VII and VIII. Gross total resection was achieved with Simpson Grade II removal (complete tumor removal with coagulation of dural attachment). Dura was closed in watertight fashion. Bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates and screws. Wound was closed in layers.

## FINDINGS
4.2 cm firm, well-circumscribed extra-axial mass with dural attachment in the right posterior fossa, compressing the cerebellum, pons, and cranial nerves VII and VIII. The tumor was moderately vascular. No obvious invasion of surrounding neural structures.

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
350 mL

## COMPLICATIONS
None

## DISPOSITION
Patient transferred to Neurosurgical ICU in stable condition.

**Disease Course Summary:**
This 69-year-old male stage artist initially presented with a symptomatic left frontal convexity meningioma (WHO Grade I) which was successfully resected. Over the course of 6 years, he developed multiple new meningiomas requiring additional surgeries and radiation treatments. His disease showed progressive increase in grade from WHO Grade I to II to III, with his final presentation showing malignant transformation to anaplastic meningioma with multiple new lesions. His functional status declined from KPS 90 at his best to KPS 30 at the end of his disease course. His occupation as a stage artist was significantly impacted by his disease, requiring modifications and eventually complete cessation of his performance career. The patient survived approximately 6 years from initial diagnosis to death.","# NEUROSURGICAL CLINICAL NOTE

# NEUROSURGICAL OPERATIVE NOTE

**Date of Surgery**: August 8, 2014
**Procedure**: Left craniotomy for resection of convexity meningioma
**Surgeon**: Dr. [Neurosurgeon]
**Anesthesia**: General endotracheal

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left convexity meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left convexity meningioma (WHO Grade I, pending final pathology)

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and positioned supine with the head turned to the right. A left-sided horseshoe-shaped incision was made, and a craniotomy was performed. Upon opening the dura, a well-circumscribed, firm, extra-axial mass was identified. The tumor was carefully dissected from the surrounding brain tissue using microsurgical technique. The tumor had a clear plane of dissection from the brain parenchyma but was firmly attached to the dura. The dural attachment was coagulated and resected. Gross total resection was achieved. Hemostasis was obtained. The dura was closed in a watertight fashion. The bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates and screws. The galea and skin were closed in layers. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Estimated blood loss was 300cc. The patient was extubated and transferred to the neurosurgical ICU in stable condition.

## IMMEDIATE POSTOPERATIVE NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION
Patient follows commands in all extremities. Right-sided weakness persists but is unchanged from preoperative baseline.

## PLAN
1. Routine postoperative care in neurosurgical ICU
2. Continue dexamethasone with taper plan
3. Continue levetiracetam 1000mg twice daily
4. Obtain postoperative MRI within 24-48 hours
5. Physical therapy and occupational therapy consultation for rehabilitation

**MRI Brain with and without contrast (June 10, 2014)**: 
5.4 cm enhancing extra-axial mass arising from the right sphenoid wing with extension into the right orbit, causing compression of the right optic nerve and displacement of extraocular muscles. Mass demonstrates homogeneous enhancement with dural tail. Minimal surrounding edema. Radiographic characteristics consistent with meningioma.

## IMPRESSION
Right sphenoid wing meningioma (5.4 cm), WHO Grade I (presumptive radiological diagnosis). The tumor is causing progressive neurological symptoms including proptosis, diplopia, facial sensory changes, and headaches. The location and size are consistent with the patient's occupational difficulties in both financial analysis (concentration) and wine tasting (taste perception).

## PLAN
After thorough discussion of management options including surgery and radiation therapy, patient expresses preference for conservative management given his age and concerns about potential complications affecting his quality of life and professional abilities. We will proceed with watchful waiting approach:

1. Repeat MRI in 3 months to establish growth rate
2. Dexamethasone 4mg daily for 7 days to reduce perilesional edema, then taper over 5 days
3. Referral to neuro-ophthalmology for baseline assessment and monitoring of visual function
4. Continue current medications
5. Consider low-dose propranolol 10mg BID for headache prophylaxis
6. Return to clinic in 3 months with repeat imaging
7. Patient advised to report any worsening of symptoms, particularly visual changes or increased headaches

**KPS Score**: 90 - Able to carry on normal activity with minor symptoms

# OPERATIVE NOTE
**Date:** May 20, 2014
**Procedure:** Left parasagittal craniotomy for resection of meningioma

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left parasagittal meningioma

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Left parasagittal meningioma, suspected WHO Grade I

## PROCEDURE DETAILS
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head fixed in Mayfield pins. Neuronavigation was registered. A left parasagittal craniotomy was performed. Upon dural opening, a well-circumscribed, firm extra-axial mass was identified with dural attachment to the falx and adjacent to but not invading the superior sagittal sinus. The tumor was carefully dissected from surrounding brain tissue and completely resected including dural attachment (Simpson Grade I). Hemostasis was achieved. Dura was closed in watertight fashion with duraplasty. Bone flap was secured, and the wound was closed in layers.

## SURGICAL CONSULTATION NOTE

Patient seen for neurosurgical consultation regarding growing parasagittal/falx meningioma with progressive symptoms. After reviewing imaging and discussing options with the patient, I have recommended subtotal resection rather than attempted gross total resection due to tumor location and involvement with the superior sagittal sinus. This approach aims to reduce mass effect while minimizing risk of venous infarction or significant neurological deficit.

Patient has expressed understanding of the risks and benefits of surgery versus continued conservative management. Given the clear progression despite medical therapy, she has elected to proceed with surgery but has requested the most conservative surgical approach possible to preserve function.

Surgery scheduled for May 20, 2015.

Pre-operative clearance and labs ordered.

**Chief Complaint**: Progressive headaches for 4 months, right-sided leg weakness, episodes of confusion, word-finding difficulties, recent seizure activity, visual disturbances (blurred vision in right visual field)

**History of Present Illness**:
Patient presents with 4-month history of progressive headaches that have been increasing in frequency and intensity. He describes them as ""different from previous migraines"" with pressure sensation behind the eyes. Over the past 6 weeks, he has developed right-sided weakness, particularly in the leg, making it difficult to maintain his work as a construction site manager which requires regular mobility across uneven terrain. He reports 3 episodes of confusion in the past month where he ""couldn't find the right words"" and appeared disoriented to his wife. Two weeks ago, he experienced his first seizure at work, with witnesses reporting generalized tonic-clonic movements lasting approximately 2 minutes. Since then, he has noticed blurred vision, predominantly affecting his right visual field.

**Past Medical History**:
- Hypertension controlled with lisinopril
- History of migraines in his 30s (resolved)

## OPERATIVE NOTE - March 22, 2014

**Procedure**: Left parasagittal craniotomy for resection of falx meningioma

**Pre-operative Diagnosis**: 4.0 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma with mass effect and peritumoral edema

**Post-operative Diagnosis**: Meningioma, WHO Grade I (pending final pathology)

**Surgeon**: Dr. [Redacted]

**Anesthesia**: General endotracheal

**Estimated Blood Loss**: 350 mL

**Complications**: None

**Procedure Details**:
Patient positioned supine with head fixed in Mayfield pins. Left parasagittal craniotomy performed. Upon dural opening, a well-circumscribed, firm, vascular tumor was identified along the falx cerebri with compression of adjacent brain parenchyma. The tumor demonstrated attachment to the superior sagittal sinus but did not appear to invade the sinus lumen. Careful microsurgical dissection was performed to separate tumor from surrounding brain tissue. Gross total resection achieved (Simpson Grade II) with preservation of the superior sagittal sinus. Intraoperative frozen section consistent with meningioma. Hemostasis obtained. Dural closure with watertight repair. Bone flap replaced and secured. Wound closed in layers.

**Intraoperative Neuromonitoring**: Stable motor and somatosensory evoked potentials throughout the procedure.

**Post-operative Plan**:
1. ICU monitoring overnight
2. Continue Dexamethasone with taper
3. Continue Levetiracetam
4. Post-operative MRI within 24 hours
5. Early mobilization and rehabilitation
