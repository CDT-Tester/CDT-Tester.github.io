**History of Present Illness**: 
Patient is a previously healthy 7-year-old male who has developed progressive right-sided weakness over the past 3 months. Parents report 2 seizure episodes in the past 2 weeks, described as generalized tonic-clonic events lasting approximately 2 minutes each. Morning headaches have become increasingly severe, occasionally accompanied by vomiting. Teachers have noted decreased school performance and parents report increased irritability. Patient has developed difficulty with writing and other fine motor tasks with his right hand. Visual complaints include intermittent blurring.

**Past Medical History**: 
- Normal developmental milestones
- Minor head trauma 6 months ago (playground fall, no LOC)
- Up-to-date on vaccinations
- No prior surgeries

# NEUROSURGICAL CONSULTATION NOTE
**Date**: January 15, 2019
**Patient**: 7-year-old male, blood type A
**Reason for Consultation**: Left parietal convexity meningioma with cerebral invasion

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient is a previously healthy 7-year-old male referred by pediatrician for evaluation of progressive right-sided weakness over the past 3 months. Parents report morning headaches, occasional vomiting, and new-onset seizures (two episodes in the past month). They have also noticed difficulty with fine motor skills in his right hand and concerning behavioral changes including irritability and decreased school performance. Teacher has reported the child appears to have some visual disturbances in class.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Normal developmental milestones
- Playground fall with minor head trauma 6 months ago (no loss of consciousness)
- Up-to-date on vaccinations
- No prior surgeries
- No known allergies
- No family history of brain tumors or cancer syndromes

## MEDICATIONS
- None

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
- Vital signs: Stable
- General: Alert, somewhat irritable child
- HEENT: Fundoscopic exam shows early papilledema
- Neurological:
  - Mental status: Age-appropriate, slightly distractible
  - Cranial nerves: Intact
  - Motor: Right-sided weakness (4/5 in upper extremity, 4+/5 in lower extremity)
  - Sensory: Intact to light touch
  - Coordination: Mild dysdiadochokinesia on right
  - Reflexes: 3+ on right, 2+ on left
  - Gait: Mild right-sided limp

## IMAGING
MRI Brain with contrast reveals a 6.2 cm × 5.4 cm × 4.8 cm (80.5 cm³) enhancing extra-axial mass in the left parietal convexity with evidence of cerebral invasion. Significant surrounding edema with 5mm midline shift. Radiographic features consistent with meningioma.

## ASSESSMENT
7-year-old male with large left parietal convexity meningioma with cerebral invasion, causing progressive neurological deficits including right-sided weakness, seizures, and increased intracranial pressure symptoms.

## IMPRESSION
Given the size of the tumor, evidence of cerebral invasion, and progressive neurological deterioration, this case is concerning for a high-grade meningioma despite the young age. While I typically favor conservative management, the rapid progression of symptoms and significant mass effect necessitate intervention.

## PLAN
1. Discussed management options with parents including risks and benefits of:
   - Surgical resection
   - Conservative management with close observation
   - Biopsy only

2. Given the progressive symptoms and size of the tumor, I recommend surgical intervention for tissue diagnosis and cytoreduction, despite my usual preference for conservative approaches.

3. Will order genetic testing for NF2 and other hereditary tumor syndromes given the unusual presentation of meningioma in a child.

4. Scheduled for surgery in 1 week.

5. Started on Dexamethasone 0.25mg/kg/day in divided doses and Levetiracetam 20mg/kg/day in divided doses.

6. KPS score: 80 (able to carry on normal activity with effort, some signs of disease)

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs:** BP 146/88, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 36.7°C, SpO2 97% on room air

**General:** Obese male in no acute distress, alert and oriented x3

**HEENT:** Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Extraocular movements with horizontal diplopia on right lateral gaze. Mild dysarthria present.

**Neurological:**
- **Mental Status:** Alert and oriented x3. Normal attention and concentration.
- **Cranial Nerves:** CN II-VIII intact. Mild dysarthria noted.
- **Motor:** 5/5 strength throughout, though with mild difficulty with rapid alternating movements of the right hand.
- **Sensory:** Intact to light touch, pinprick, and proprioception.
- **Cerebellar:** Dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing bilaterally, more pronounced on the right. Ataxic gait with widened base. Difficulty with tandem walking.
- **Reflexes:** 2+ and symmetric throughout. Downgoing plantar responses bilaterally.

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

**MRI Brain with and without contrast (09/10/2014):**
Reveals a 3.8 cm × 3.2 cm × 2.9 cm (18.3 cm³) homogeneously enhancing extra-axial mass in the posterior fossa, compressing the cerebellum and fourth ventricle. Mild to moderate hydrocephalus is present. Radiographic features are consistent with a posterior fossa meningioma. Mild perilesional edema noted.

## IMPRESSION
1. Posterior fossa mass, most consistent with meningioma (WHO grade I), causing cerebellar compression, mild to moderate hydrocephalus, and associated cerebellar symptoms.
2. History of radiation exposure to head and neck region 15 years ago, which may be contributory to meningioma development.
3. Multiple comorbidities including poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, increasing surgical risk.

## PLAN
After thorough discussion with the patient regarding treatment options, risks, and benefits, we have decided to pursue a conservative management approach with close monitoring:

1. **Watchful waiting approach** with serial MRI scans every 3 months for the first year to monitor for growth.
2. **Medical management** of symptoms:
   - Dexamethasone 4mg BID for 5 days, then taper to 2mg BID for 5 days, then 1mg daily for 5 days to reduce perilesional edema and manage symptoms
   - Ondansetron 4mg PRN for nausea/vomiting
   - Consider acetazolamide 250mg BID if hydrocephalus symptoms worsen

3. **Neurosurgical follow-up** in 6 weeks to reassess symptoms and response to medical management.

4. **Considerations for conservative approach:**
   - Patient's multiple comorbidities increase surgical risk
   - Patient's occupation as an architect requires fine motor skills that could be further compromised with aggressive intervention
   - Tumor location in posterior fossa increases surgical risk
   - Patient preference for non-surgical approach if feasible

5. **Indications for intervention would include:**
   - Significant tumor growth on follow-up imaging
   - Worsening hydrocephalus requiring CSF diversion
   - Progressive neurological deterioration despite medical management

6. **Patient education** regarding warning signs requiring immediate attention: severe headache, vision changes, new onset vomiting, altered mental status, or worsening balance issues.

7. **Referral to endocrinology** for optimization of diabetes management.

8. **Karnofsky Performance Status:** 80% (Normal activity with effort, some symptoms of disease)

Patient understands the management plan and agrees to close follow-up. He has been advised to contact our office for any worsening symptoms before the scheduled follow-up.

## Initial Consultation - March 15, 2014

**Chief Complaint:** Progressive hearing loss in right ear, balance difficulties, persistent headaches, neck pain radiating to right shoulder, occasional dizziness when changing positions, right-sided facial numbness, difficulty swallowing, unsteady gait, tinnitus in right ear

**History of Present Illness:** 
47-year-old female software engineer presenting with progressive neurological symptoms over the past 6 months. Patient reports worsening right-sided hearing loss and tinnitus, with increasing difficulty maintaining balance, particularly when working long hours at computer. Headaches described as constant pressure, 7/10 severity, poorly responsive to OTC analgesics. Patient reports significant impact on work performance due to symptoms.

**Past Medical History:**
- Hypertension controlled with lisinopril
- Surgical removal of a small skin meningioma 8 years ago
- Family history of neurofibromatosis type 2 (mother)
- Migraine headaches since early adulthood
- Mild scoliosis
- Tonsillectomy at age 12
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use

**Current Medications:**
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Sumatriptan 50mg PRN for migraines
- Ibuprofen 600mg PRN for headaches

**Physical Examination:**
- Vital Signs: BP 138/86, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 98.6°F
- HEENT: Right-sided facial numbness in V2/V3 distribution
- Neurological: Right-sided sensorineural hearing loss, decreased corneal reflex on right, diminished gag reflex, right-sided facial weakness (House-Brackmann Grade II), mild dysmetria on right, positive Romberg test, unsteady tandem gait
- Cerebellar: Mild right-sided dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing
- Motor: 5/5 strength throughout, though with mild right-sided coordination deficits
- Sensory: Diminished light touch and pinprick sensation in right V2/V3 distribution

**Diagnostic Studies:**
MRI brain with and without contrast reveals multiple intracranial masses consistent with meningiomas:
1. 5.7 cm right cerebellopontine angle mass with significant brainstem compression
2. 2.3 cm left cerebellopontine angle mass
3. 3.1 cm falx meningioma
4. 2.8 cm parasagittal meningioma
5. C2 spinal meningioma measuring 1.2 cm
Combined volume approximately 97 cm³

**Impression:**
Multiple intracranial and spinal meningiomas with significant mass effect at the right cerebellopontine angle causing brainstem compression and cranial nerve dysfunction. Given family history of NF2, high suspicion for neurofibromatosis type 2. Occupational demands as software engineer likely exacerbating symptoms due to prolonged screen time and static positioning.

**Plan:**
1. Urgent neurosurgical intervention recommended for right CP angle mass to decompress brainstem and preserve cranial nerve function
2. Genetic testing for NF2 mutation
3. Full spine MRI to evaluate for additional lesions
4. Neurosurgery scheduled for 1 week from today
5. Dexamethasone 4mg QID to reduce perilesional edema
6. Audiometry and vestibular testing pre-operatively
7. Recommend medical leave from work immediately
8. Referral to NF2 specialist center post-surgery

KPS: 70 - Cares for self but unable to carry on normal activity or do active work

## Operative Note - March 23, 2014

**Procedure:** Right retrosigmoid craniotomy for resection of right cerebellopontine angle meningioma

**Preoperative Diagnosis:** Multiple intracranial meningiomas, right cerebellopontine angle mass causing significant brainstem compression and cranial nerve dysfunction

**Postoperative Diagnosis:** Multiple meningiomas consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma (pending final pathology)

**Findings:**
Large right cerebellopontine angle meningioma with significant compression of CN VII and VIII. Tumor densely adherent to brainstem and cranial nerves. Simpson Grade II resection achieved with small amount of tumor capsule left on brainstem to preserve neural function.

**Estimated Blood Loss:** 350cc
**Complications:** None

**Description of Procedure:**
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned in the left lateral position with the right side up. Neuromonitoring was established for facial nerve and brainstem auditory evoked responses. A right retrosigmoid approach was utilized. Upon dural opening, the cerebellum was gently retracted to expose a large, well-vascularized meningioma. The tumor was internally debulked using ultrasonic aspirator. The tumor was found to be densely adherent to the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves. Careful microdissection was performed to separate tumor from these structures. A small portion of tumor capsule was left attached to the brainstem to preserve neural function. Hemostasis was achieved. Dural closure was performed with a dural substitute. Bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates. Wound was closed in layers.

**Plan:**
1. ICU monitoring overnight
2. MRI brain postoperatively
3. Continue dexamethasone with taper
4. Facial nerve and swallowing evaluation post-operatively
5. Discuss additional tumors at Skull Base MDT next week

The multiple simultaneous meningiomas along with vestibular symptoms strongly suggest this diagnosis.

## PLAN
1. Genetic testing for NF2 mutations
2. Referral to NF2 specialized center (Cambridge) per NHS guidelines
3. Watchful waiting approach with close monitoring given patient's current functional status and occupation
4. Follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess growth rate
5. Consider ventriculoperitoneal shunt if signs of increased intracranial pressure develop
6. Audiological follow-up and consideration of hearing aids for right ear
7. Physical therapy referral for balance training
8. Referral to speech therapy for swallowing assessment
9. Medication adjustments:
   - Continue lisinopril 10mg daily
   - Add dexamethasone 4mg BID for 1 week, then taper to 2mg BID for perilesional edema
   - Consider prophylactic anti-seizure medication given tumor burden

Patient advised to report any worsening symptoms immediately, including increased headaches, visual changes, new neurological deficits, or worsening balance issues.

# NEUROSURGICAL OPERATIVE NOTE

**Date: September 2, 2014**
**Patient**: Jane Doe, 47-year-old female

## PROCEDURE
Right retrosigmoid approach for partial resection of right cerebellopontine angle meningioma

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Multiple meningiomas with large right cerebellopontine angle tumor in setting of neurofibromatosis type 2

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Same as preoperative diagnosis. Pathology pending.

## DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE
After induction of general anesthesia, patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus position with right side up. A right retrosigmoid craniotomy was performed. Upon opening the dura, significant tumor burden was visualized compressing the cerebellum and brainstem. The tumor was firm and highly vascular. Cranial nerves VII and VIII were engulfed by tumor. Careful microdissection was performed to debulk the tumor and decompress the brainstem. Approximately 60% of the tumor was removed, with residual tumor left adherent to cranial nerves and brainstem to avoid further neurological deficit. Hemostasis was achieved. Dura was closed with a dural substitute patch. Bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates. Wound was closed in layers. Patient remained stable throughout the procedure.

Estimated blood loss: 450 mL
Complications: None

## PLAN
1. Transfer to Neurosurgical ICU for post-operative monitoring
2. Routine post-operative care
3. Steroid taper as tolerated
4. Pathology results pending

# RADIATION ONCOLOGY CONSULTATION

**Date: October 10, 2014**
**Patient**: Jane Doe, 47-year-old female

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patient with NF2 and multiple meningiomas, status post partial resection of right CP angle tumor on September 2, 2014. Referred for consideration of stereotactic radiosurgery for residual tumor.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
- Vital Signs: BP 134/82, HR 76, RR 16, Temp 36.8°C
- Neurological: Right facial weakness, absent hearing right ear, impaired balance, dysphagia

## IMAGING REVIEW
Review of MRI from September 10, 2014 shows partial resection of right CP angle meningioma with approximately 40% residual tumor (estimated volume 15cc). Multiple other meningiomas present in bilateral CP angles, falx, parasagittal region, and C2 spine.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Patient with residual WHO Grade I meningioma after partial resection. Given the tumor volume (15cc) and proximity to brainstem and cranial nerves, recommend fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy rather than single-fraction radiosurgery per NHS guidelines.

Treatment plan:
1. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy to residual right CP angle meningioma
2. Dose: 54 Gy in 30 fractions
3. Treatment to begin in 2 weeks after planning MRI and simulation
4. Will monitor for radiation-related side effects including fatigue, local skin reaction, and potential temporary worsening of neurological symptoms

Long-term plan will include consideration of treatment for other meningiomas based on growth patterns and symptoms.

## INITIAL CONSULTATION: 04/15/2019

**PATIENT**: 36-year-old female, A+ blood type, 24 weeks pregnant (first child)
**OCCUPATION**: Clinical Psychologist
**REASON FOR REFERRAL**: Abnormal MRI findings following neurological symptoms

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**:
Patient presents with progressive neurological symptoms during second trimester of pregnancy. Reports intermittent headaches increasing in frequency and severity over past 3 months, distinct from her historical migraine pattern. Additional symptoms include occasional blurry vision, recent onset of mild right-sided weakness, episodes of confusion and word-finding difficulties (particularly problematic during patient sessions), and morning nausea initially attributed to pregnancy. Husband witnessed one episode of seizure-like activity 2 weeks ago, prompting emergency evaluation.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY**:
- Migraine headaches since adolescence (pattern has changed recently)
- History of mild depression, treated with therapy only
- Currently 24 weeks pregnant with first child
- Normal prenatal care with unremarkable first and second trimester screenings
- No prior neurological disorders
- No history of cancer
- No significant family history of brain tumors
- No prior surgeries
- No known allergies

**MEDICATIONS**:
- Prenatal vitamins
- Occasional acetaminophen for headaches

**IMAGING FINDINGS**:
MRI reveals a 3.2 cm × 2.8 cm intraventricular mass in the right lateral ventricle without dural attachment, volume approximately 13.1 cm³. Mass demonstrates homogeneous enhancement with contrast. No significant peritumoral edema observed. Mild ventricular enlargement noted. Findings consistent with intraventricular meningioma.

**NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION**:
- Alert and oriented x3
- Mild right-sided weakness (4+/5) in upper extremity
- Subtle right facial droop
- Visual fields intact to confrontation, but reports intermittent blurry vision
- Reflexes 2+ and symmetric
- Mild dysmetria on right with finger-to-nose testing
- Gait stable but slightly cautious

**ASSESSMENT**:
Intraventricular meningioma (WHO Grade I suspected, pending pathology), right lateral ventricle. The tumor's location and size, combined with the patient's pregnancy and progressive neurological symptoms, are concerning. Intraventricular meningiomas without dural attachment are uncommon and can be more challenging to manage. Given the patient's pregnancy status, rapid intervention is indicated to prevent further neurological deterioration and potential complications for both mother and fetus.

**PLAN**:
1. Urgent neurosurgical intervention recommended before further neurological deterioration occurs
2. Recommend surgical resection at 26 weeks gestation (optimal timing balancing fetal development and maternal neurological risk)
3. Multidisciplinary approach with high-risk OB, anesthesiology, and neurosurgery
4. Start levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis (pregnancy category C, but benefits outweigh risks)
5. MRI with volumetric sequences to facilitate surgical planning
6. Genetic testing to rule out NF2 and other hereditary syndromes
7. Detailed discussion with patient regarding risks/benefits of surgery during pregnancy
8. Weekly neurological checks until surgery

**WHO CLASSIFICATION**: Presumed Grade I meningioma (pending pathology)
**KPS**: 80 (Normal activity with effort, some signs/symptoms of disease)

## SURGICAL NOTE: 04/29/2019

**PROCEDURE**: Right frontal craniotomy for resection of intraventricular meningioma

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Right lateral ventricle meningioma
**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Right lateral ventricle meningioma, WHO Grade II (pending final pathology)

**INDICATIONS**: 36-year-old female at 26 weeks gestation with progressive neurological symptoms and 3.2 × 2.8 cm right lateral ventricle mass.

**PROCEDURE DETAILS**:
Under general anesthesia and continuous fetal monitoring, a right frontal craniotomy was performed. Transcortical approach through the middle frontal gyrus provided access to the lateral ventricle. Upon entering the ventricle, a well-circumscribed, firm, vascular tumor was identified. The tumor appeared to originate from the ependymal lining without dural attachment. Microsurgical techniques were employed for careful dissection. The tumor demonstrated significant vascularity requiring meticulous hemostasis. Gross total resection was achieved with preservation of surrounding structures. Ventricular catheter was placed temporarily and removed at the end of the procedure after confirming adequate CSF flow. Estimated blood loss: 350cc. No complications occurred. Fetal monitoring remained stable throughout the procedure.

**INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS**:
Tumor appeared more vascular and infiltrative than typical Grade I meningioma. Frozen section suggested possible Grade II features. Multiple specimens sent for permanent pathology.

**POSTOPERATIVE PLAN**:
1. Neuro ICU monitoring for 24 hours
2. Continued fetal monitoring
3. Serial neurological examinations
4. Early mobilization
5. Follow-up MRI within 48 hours
6. High-risk OB consultation daily
7. Await final pathology

**WHO CLASSIFICATION**: Grade II (atypical) meningioma (preliminary based on frozen section)
**KPS**: 60 (Requires occasional assistance, cares for most needs)

**OBJECTIVE**:
- Incision healing well without signs of infection
- Right-sided strength improved to 5/5
- Facial symmetry restored
- No papilledema on fundoscopic exam
- Mild word-finding difficulties on detailed language testing

**IMAGING**: Post-operative MRI shows gross total resection of the tumor. No evidence of residual tumor. Ventricle size normalized. Minimal expected post-surgical changes.

**LABORATORY**: 
- Final pathology confirms WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma
- Ki-67 proliferation index: 12%
- Increased mitotic activity (6 mitoses per 10 HPF)
- Brain invasion not identified
- Genetic testing: No NF2 mutations detected; however, TERT promoter mutation identified, suggesting more aggressive potential

**ASSESSMENT**:
Grade II (atypical) meningioma of the right lateral ventricle, gross total resection achieved. The TERT promoter mutation and elevated Ki-67 index are concerning for more aggressive behavior. Pregnancy adds complexity to management decisions.

**PLAN**:
1. Close monitoring with serial MRIs (first at 28 weeks gestation, then monthly until delivery)
2. Continue levetiracetam 500mg BID
3. Defer radiotherapy decision until after delivery
4. High-risk OB to continue monitoring pregnancy weekly
5. Neuropsychological evaluation to establish baseline
6. Return to clinic in 2 weeks
7. Detailed discussion regarding potential for rapid growth during pregnancy and need for vigilant monitoring

**MEDICATIONS**:
- Levetiracetam 500mg BID

## MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM NOTE: 05/25/2019

**PARTICIPANTS**: Neurosurgery, High-Risk Obstetrics, Neonatology, Neuro-Oncology, Anesthesiology

**DISCUSSION**:
Case of 36-year-old female, 28 weeks pregnant with aggressive atypical meningioma with ventricular dissemination and hydrocephalus. CSF cytology positive for tumor cells. Whole neuraxis MRI reveals early nodular enhancement in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine, concerning for CSF seeding.

**CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS**:
1. Proceed with C-section delivery at 30 weeks gestation (approximately 2 weeks from now)
2. Convert EVD to ventriculoperitoneal shunt prior to delivery
3. Post-delivery plan to include repeat craniotomy for recurrent tumor followed by craniospinal radiation
4. Consider enrollment in clinical trial for recurrent/aggressive meningioma

**GENETIC TESTING UPDATE**:
Additional tumor genetic analysis reveals multiple chromosomal abnormalities including losses on 1p, 6q, 10, and 14q, as well as the previously identified TERT promoter mutation. These findings are consistent with a highly aggressive phenotype.

## INITIAL CONSULTATION
**Date: March 15, 2014**

**Patient:** 36-year-old female, 24 weeks pregnant (G1P0)
**Blood Type:** A+
**Occupation:** Clinical Psychologist

**Chief Complaint:**
- Intermittent headaches increasing in frequency and severity over past 3 months
- Visual disturbances including occasional blurry vision
- Recent onset of mild right-sided weakness
- Episodes of confusion and difficulty finding words during patient sessions
- Nausea particularly in morning (initially attributed to pregnancy)

- Normal prenatal care with unremarkable first and second trimester screenings
- No prior neurological disorders
- No history of cancer
- No significant family history of brain tumors
- No prior surgeries
- No known allergies

**Medications:**
- Prenatal vitamins
- Occasional acetaminophen for headaches

**Imaging:**
MRI Brain (with limited contrast protocol due to pregnancy): 3.2 cm × 2.8 cm mass in right lateral ventricle without dural attachment. Volume approximately 13.1 cm³. Characteristics consistent with intraventricular meningioma. Mild periventricular edema noted. No evidence of hydrocephalus at present.

## BIOPSY RESULTS
**Date: May 3, 2014**

**Pathology Results:**
Endoscopic biopsy of right ventricular mass shows atypical meningioma (WHO Grade II) with elevated MIB-1 proliferation index of 12%. Areas of clear cell and chordoid features noted.

**Genetic Analysis:**
Tumor demonstrates NF2 gene mutation and TERT promoter mutation (C228T), unusual for typical meningiomas and associated with more aggressive behavior. Additional mutations in SMARCE1 gene detected, which is associated with clear cell meningiomas.

**Assessment:**
WHO Grade II atypical meningioma with aggressive molecular profile explaining rapid growth during pregnancy and CSF dissemination. The presence of TERT promoter mutation suggests higher risk of progression and recurrence.

**Plan:**
1. Convert EVD to permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt
2. Initiate fractionated radiotherapy to primary tumor site after recovery from shunt placement
3. Discuss spinal radiation for disseminated disease
4. Continue antiepileptic and steroid management
5. Regular clinical and radiographic follow-up
6. Genetic counseling regarding implications for patient and infant
7. Supportive care and symptom management

**KPS Score:** 70
